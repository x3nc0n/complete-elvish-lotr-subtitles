00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:26,625
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>Estel, le iôn adar lín...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Hope, you are your father’s son... ♫

3
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:34,747
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>... û iôn naneth lín.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ ... not your mother’s child. ♫

4
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:39,021
[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

5
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,774
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

6
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,735
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

7
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,035
That you'd never escape your fate.

8
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:56,935
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

9
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:01,336
...but only you have the power to wield it.

10
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,936
I do not want that power.

11
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,736
I have never wanted it.

12
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:11,614
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

13
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,481
My old sword!
Sting.

14
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:19,785
Here, take it. Take it.

15
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,238
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

16
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:33,615
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

17
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:38,345
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

18
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:40,609
Here's a pretty thing.

19
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,245
Mithril.

20
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,166
As light as a feather, and
as hard as dragon scales.

21
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:50,749
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

22
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,746
My old ring.

23
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:06,847
I should very much like...

24
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:11,047
...to hold it again, one last time.

25
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,599
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

26
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:36,636
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

27
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,403
I'm sorry for everything.

28
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,352
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

29
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,413
On you who travel with him, no oath...

30
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,653
...nor bond is laid to
go further than you will.

31
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,553
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

32
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,854
May the blessings of elves and men...

33
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:24,154
...and all free folk go with you.

34
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:31,155
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

35
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,429
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

36
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,944
Left.

37
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,464
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

38
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,465
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

39
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:26,465
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

40
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:30,366
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

41
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,366
Move your feet.

42
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,866
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

43
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,566
Faster!

44
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,567
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

45
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,467
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

46
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,456
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

47
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:52,468
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

48
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:58,068
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

49
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:08,669
Sorry!

50
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,869
Get him!

51
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,670
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

52
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,570
Gentlemen, that's enough.

53
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,241
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

54
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:26,207
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

55
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,703
It's moving fast.

56
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,471
Against the wind.

57
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,371
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

58
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,432
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

59
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,475
Spies of Saruman.

60
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,552
The passage south is being watched.

61
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,976
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

62
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,177
Frodo!

63
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,999
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>I tuo, i macil...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The strength, The weapon... ♫

64
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,479
Boromir.

65
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:00,979
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

66
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:06,248
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Astaldoron mauri...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The needs of the valiant... ♫

67
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,025
...over so small a thing.

{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Nai túren...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Be it that wictory... ♫

69
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,480
Such a little thing.

70
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,340
Boromir!

71
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,381
Give the ring to Frodo.

72
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,282
As you wish.

73
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,082
I care not.

74
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,093
So, Gandalf, you try to
lead them over Caradhras.

75
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,427
And if that fails...

76
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,086
... where then will you go?

77
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,187
If the mountain defeats you...

78
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:22,075
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

79
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:34,993
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

80
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,692
There is a fell voice on the air.

81
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,124
It's Saruman!

82
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,190
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

83
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,390
No!

84
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:02,776
[Sindarin] <i>Losto Caradhras, Sedho! Hodo!</i>
[English] Sleep Redhorn, Be still! Lie Still!

85
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,352
[Sindarin] <i>Nuitho i 'Ruith!</i>
[English] Hold your Wrath!

86
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:09,209
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

87
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,977
[Quenya] <i>Nai yarvaxëa rasselya...</i>
[English] May your bloodstained horn...

88
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:17,302
[Quenya] <i>...taltuva ñotto-carinnar!</i>
[English] ...fall upon enemy heads!

89
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,966
We must get off the mountain!

90
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,772
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

91
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,272
The Gap of Rohan takes
us too close to Isengard!

92
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,897
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

93
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,632
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

94
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:26,062
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

95
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,670
The dwarves delved
too greedily and too deep.

96
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,999
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

97
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,700
Shadow and flame.

98
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:48,042
Let the ring-bearer decide.

99
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,991
We cannot stay here!

100
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,701
This will be the death of the hobbits.

101
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,601
Frodo?

102
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,402
We will go through the mines.

103
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,138
So be it.

104
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:18,236
Frodo, come and help an old man.

105
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,404
How is your shoulder?

106
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,540
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

107
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,109
You feel its power growing, don't you?

108
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,528
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

109
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:39,605
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

110
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,405
And, I fear, from within.

111
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:49,024
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

112
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,924
Trust your own strengths.

113
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,106
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

114
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,307
...for good or for evil.

115
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,807
Some are greater than I am.

116
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,807
And against some I
have not yet been tested.

117
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,047
The walls...

118
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,508
...of Moria.

119
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:18,209
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

120
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,838
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

121
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,709
Why doesn't that surprise me?

122
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,910
Well, let's see.

123
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,710
Ithildin.

124
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,611
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

125
00:13:56,812 --> 00:14:01,481
It reads; "The Doors
of Durin, Lord of Moria.

126
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:06,213
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

127
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,514
Oh It's quite simple.

128
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,313
If you are a friend, you speak the
password and the doors will open.

129
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:16,197
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

130
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:30,545
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

131
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,223
Nothing's happening.

132
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,492
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

133
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,217
...men and orcs.

134
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,538
- What are you going to do, then?
- Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!

135
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,324
And if that does not shatter them...

136
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,218
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

137
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,217
...I will try to find the opening words.

138
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,229
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

139
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:11,729
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

140
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,829
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

141
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,220
Mines are no place for a pony.

142
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:20,788
Even one so brave as Bill.

143
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:22,907
Bye-bye, Bill.

144
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,275
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

145
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,520
Go on, Bill. Go on.

146
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,721
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

147
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,022
Do not disturb the water.

148
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,222
Oh, it's useless.

149
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:57,023
It's a riddle.

150
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:02,967
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

151
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,661
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

152
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,461
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

153
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:08,924
Mellon.

154
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:32,090
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

155
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,534
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

156
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:43,215
This, my friend, is the
home of my cousin Balin.

157
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,428
And they call it a mine.

158
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,051
A mine!

159
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:52,253
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

160
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,846
No....

161
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,529
No!

162
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,730
Goblins.

163
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,830
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

164
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,866
Now, get out of here. Get out!

165
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,731
- Frodo!
- Help!

166
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,631
Strider!

167
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,432
- Help!
- Get off him!

168
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,011
Aragorn!

169
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,529
Frodo!

170
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,128
Into the mines!

171
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:11,936
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

172
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,036
Run!

173
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,945
We now have but one choice.

174
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:43,438
We must face the long dark of Moria.

175
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,944
Be on your guard.

176
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:50,081
There are older and
fouler things than orcs...

177
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:53,139
...in the deep places of the world.

178
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:04,940
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

179
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:09,041
Let us hope that our
presence may go unnoticed.

180
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,545
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

181
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,246
...or jewels...

182
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,441
...but mithril.

183
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:27,548
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

184
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,848
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

185
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,949
I never told him...

186
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,949
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

187
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,150
Pippin.

188
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:16,353
I have no memory of this place.

189
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,657
- Are we Lost?
- No.

190
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,653
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

191
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,628
- Merry?
- What?

192
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:26,453
I'm hungry.

193
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,763
There's something down there.

194
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,154
It's Gollum.

195
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,082
Gollum?

196
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:46,455
He's been following
us for three days.

197
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,665
He escaped the
dungeons of Barad-dûr?

198
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,285
Escaped...

199
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,356
...or was set loose.

200
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,456
But now the ring has brought him here.

201
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,857
He will never be rid of his need for it.

202
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:08,657
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

203
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:13,027
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

204
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:19,858
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

205
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:23,759
Before it drove him mad.

206
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,859
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

207
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,722
Pity?

208
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,260
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

209
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:38,473
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

210
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:42,626
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

211
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,661
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

212
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,761
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

213
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:58,162
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

214
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,962
...before this is over.

215
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:07,263
The pity of Bilbo may
rule the fate of many.

216
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,364
I wish the ring had never come to me.

217
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,864
I wish none of this had happened.

218
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:26,777
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

219
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:32,265
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

220
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:37,766
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

221
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:40,943
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

222
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,466
In which case, you also
were meant to have it.

223
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,867
And that is an encouraging thought.

224
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,767
It's that way.

225
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,267
- He's remembered.
- No.

226
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,862
But the air doesn't
smell so foul down here.

227
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:07,094
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

228
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,570
Let me risk a little more light.

229
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,371
Behold...

230
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,971
...the great realm and
dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

231
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:44,872
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

232
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:11,674
Gimli!

233
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,675
No!

234
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,376
Oh, no.

235
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:29,706
No.

236
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,777
"Here lies Balin...

237
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:41,277
...son of Fundin...

238
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,800
...Lord of Moria."

239
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:47,021
He is dead, then.

240
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:50,503
It's as I feared.

241
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:11,762
We must move on. We cannot linger.

242
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:16,285
"They have taken the
bridge and the second hall.

243
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
We have barred the gates...

244
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,181
...but cannot hold them for long.

245
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,181
The ground shakes.

246
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:28,181
Drums...

247
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,882
...drums in the deep.

248
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,582
We cannot get out.

249
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:43,383
A shadow moves in the dark.

250
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,683
We cannot get out.

251
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,583
They are coming."

252
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,588
Fool of a Took!

253
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,588
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

254
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,391
Frodo!

255
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,191
Orcs.

256
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,439
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

257
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:31,193
They have a cave-troll.

258
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,412
Let them come!

259
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,994
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

260
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,038
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

261
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,308
Frodo!

262
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:56,300
Aragorn! Aragorn!

263
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:58,512
Frodo!

264
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:45,616
Frodo!

265
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:47,695
Oh, no.

266
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,423
He's alive.

267
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,823
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

268
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,223
You should be dead.

269
00:34:05,828 --> 00:34:07,923
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

270
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,824
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

271
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,403
Mithril.

272
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,544
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

273
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,872
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

274
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,685
What is this new devilry?

275
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:22,136
A Balrog.

276
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,536
A demon of the ancient world.

277
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:30,684
This foe is beyond any of you.

278
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:32,937
Run!

279
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:41,738
Quickly!

280
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,739
Gandalf.

281
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:01,839
Lead them on, Aragorn.

282
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,840
The bridge is near.

283
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

284
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,242
Gandalf!

285
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,345
Merry! Pippin!

286
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:14,759
Sam!

287
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,548
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

288
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,700
Not the beard!

289
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,822
Steady.

290
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:44,742
Hold on!

291
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:06,723
Hang on!

292
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,338
Lean forward!

293
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,240
Steady.

294
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:25,646
Come on!

295
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:27,406
Now!

296
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:46,155
Over the bridge!

297
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:47,955
Fly!

298
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:35,120
You cannot pass!

299
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,559
Gandalf!

300
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:46,184
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

301
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:50,888
The dark fire will not
avail you, flame of Udûn!

302
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,615
Go back to the Shadow.

303
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:14,682
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

304
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,920
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

305
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,329
Fly, you fools!

306
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,449
No!

307
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:10,708
Aragorn!

308
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:10,746
Legolas, get them up.

309
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:17,078
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

310
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,821
By nightfall, these hills
will be swarming with orcs.

311
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:23,775
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

312
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,751
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

313
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:31,875
On your feet, Sam.

314
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:33,936
Frodo?

315
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:37,609
Frodo!

Well, here's one dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

332
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:20,185
I have the eyes of a
hawk and the ears of a fox.

So much for the legendary

Speak words we can all understand!

341
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,064
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

342
00:46:00,397 --> 00:46:02,564

That was not so courteous.

345
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:21,617
You bring great evil with you.

346
00:46:24,404 --> 00:46:26,504

Nor would he have you give up hope.

355
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:13,514
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

356
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:18,302
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

357
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:23,383
You will follow me.

I can no longer see him from afar.

371
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:34,309
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

372
00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:37,109
He has fallen into shadow.

373

He was taken by both shadow and flame.

A Balrog of Morgoth.

375
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:56,155
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

376
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:01,886
Needless were none of
the deeds of Gandalf in life.

377

...and in all lands love...

382
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:29,014
...is now mingled with grief.

383
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:45,090
What now becomes of this fellowship?

384
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:48,208
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

385
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:54,191
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

386
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:57,316
Stray but a little and it will fail...

387
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:01,017
...to the ruin of all.

388
00:51:05,911 --> 00:51:11,018
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

To bear a ring of power...

...is to be alone.

479
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,965
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

480
00:59:42,532 --> 00:59:44,032
And I am its keeper.

481
00:59:47,485 --> 00:59:50,985

It's just...

486
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,960
...I'm afraid to do it.

487

Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

488
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:28,562

orcs first came into being?

490

Taken by the dark powers...

491

...tortured and mutilated.

492
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:45,614
A ruined and terrible form of life.

493
01:00:46,704 --> 01:00:48,505
And now...

494
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:51,631

Hunt them down. Do not
stop until, they are found.

You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

01:02:08,578 --> 01:02:13,778
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

506
01:02:15,346 --> 01:02:19,046
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

507
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:27,866
Lembas.

508
01:02:28,233 --> 01:02:29,833
Elvish waybread.

509
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,100
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

510
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,700
How many did you eat?

511
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:45,525
Four.

512
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:53,881
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

513
01:02:54,022 --> 01:02:57,703
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

514
01:02:58,313 --> 01:03:00,658
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

515
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,918
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

516
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:09,903
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

517
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:20,628
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

518
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:27,231
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

519
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:48,987
<i>My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

520
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:53,048
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

521
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,990
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

522
01:04:01,263 --> 01:04:04,051
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

523
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,846
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

524
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:10,582
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

525
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:14,859
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

526
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,759
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

527
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,699
Thank you, my lady.

528
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,211
Have you run out of
those nice, shiny daggers?

529
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,511
And what gift would a
dwarf ask of the elves?

530
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:35,967
Nothing.

531
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,088
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

532
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:46,613
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

533
01:04:53,868 --> 01:04:55,368
Actually....

534
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:57,287
There was one thing.

535
01:04:57,923 --> 01:05:00,423
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

536
01:05:00,888 --> 01:05:02,387
Stupid to ask.

537
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:08,302
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

538
01:05:08,765 --> 01:05:11,399
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

539
01:05:12,985 --> 01:05:15,068
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

540
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:20,769
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

541
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,328
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

542
01:05:24,197 --> 01:05:28,517
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

543
01:05:31,194 --> 01:05:37,207
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

544
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,806
That choice is yet before her.

545
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:43,919
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

546
01:05:44,663 --> 01:05:49,798
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

547
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:54,811
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

548
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:03,194
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

549
01:06:07,314 --> 01:06:10,482
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

550
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:14,090
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

551
01:06:16,816 --> 01:06:19,976
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

552
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:25,402
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

553
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:28,902
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

554
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:32,302
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

555
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:45,503
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

556
01:06:46,308 --> 01:06:50,308
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

557
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:02,204
I have taken my worst
wound at this parting...

558
01:07:03,093 --> 01:07:04,978
...having looked my last upon that...

559
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:07,294
...which is fairest.

560
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:11,246
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

561
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,109
What was her gift?

562
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:17,617
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

563
01:07:19,516 --> 01:07:21,529
She gave me three.

564
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:07,617
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

565
01:09:11,808 --> 01:09:14,417
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

566
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,314
But he's too clever a waterman.

567
01:09:19,028 --> 01:09:21,405
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

568
01:09:22,497 --> 01:09:24,621
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

569
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:26,618
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

570
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:30,122
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

571
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,415
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

572
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:37,119
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

573
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:38,707
But you're not.

574
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,609
I'm here to help you.

575
01:09:41,903 --> 01:09:43,703
I promised Gandalf that I would.

576
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:51,717
You can't help me, Sam.

577
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:56,104
Not this time.

578
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:00,865
Get some sleep.

579
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,471
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

580
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:13,197
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

581
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:16,003
Strike out for Mordor
from a place of strength.

582
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,105
There is no strength in
Gondor that can avail us.

583
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:21,389
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

584
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:25,824
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

585
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:29,494
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

586
01:10:29,705 --> 01:10:32,910
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

587
01:10:32,935 --> 01:10:34,825
But you will not see that.

588
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:36,830
You are afraid!

589
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:39,800
All your life, you have
hidden in the shadows.

590
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:42,509
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

591
01:10:45,726 --> 01:10:49,302
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

592
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,410
Frodo.

593
01:11:05,396 --> 01:11:06,756
The Argonath.

We cross the lake at nightfall.

599
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:40,324
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

600
01:12:40,907 --> 01:12:43,874
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

601
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:48,109
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

602
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:52,277
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

603
01:12:52,302 --> 01:12:54,937
And after that, it gets even better.

604
01:12:55,798 --> 01:13:00,716
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

605
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,310
That is our road.

606
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:07,025
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

607
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,209
Recover my...

608
01:13:11,994 --> 01:13:13,794
- We should Leave now.
- No.

609
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:18,211
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

610
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:20,815
It is not the eastern
shore that worries me.

611
01:13:22,415 --> 01:13:25,514
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

612
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:28,604
Something draws near.

613
01:13:29,283 --> 01:13:31,218
I can feel it.

614
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:34,470
Recover strength?

615
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:37,018
Pay no heed to
that, young hobbit.

616
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,180
Where's Frodo?

617
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:07,905
None of us should wander alone.

618
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:10,721
You, least of all.

619
01:14:11,596 --> 01:14:13,593
So much depends on you.

620
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:16,634
Frodo?

621
01:14:24,123 --> 01:14:26,121
I know why you seek solitude.

622
01:14:27,424 --> 01:14:30,304
You suffer. I see it day by day.

623
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,228
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

624
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:38,295
There are other ways, Frodo.

625
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:42,401
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

626
01:14:42,987 --> 01:14:46,548
And it would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

627
01:14:47,068 --> 01:14:49,948
Warning...against what?

628
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:52,248
We're all afraid, Frodo.

629
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:56,222
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

630
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,463
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

631
01:15:02,304 --> 01:15:05,604
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

632
01:15:07,122 --> 01:15:09,289
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

633
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:14,186
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

634
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,851
What chance do you think you have?

635
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:23,651
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

636
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:27,901
And you will beg for death before the end!

637
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:31,952
You fool!

638
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:36,052
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

639
01:15:36,352 --> 01:15:39,053
It should be mine! Give it to me!

640
01:15:39,519 --> 01:15:40,828
- Give it to me!
- No!

641
01:15:40,942 --> 01:15:42,742
- Give it to me!
- No.

642
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:52,504
I see your mind.

643
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:55,615
You will take the ring to Sauron!

644
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:57,721
You will betray us!

645
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:01,200
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

646
01:16:01,703 --> 01:16:05,486
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:30,804
He will not understand.

673
01:18:34,316 --> 01:18:35,916
Go, Frodo!

674
01:18:38,996 --> 01:18:40,167
Run.

675
01:18:40,779 --> 01:18:41,825
Run!

676
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:08,591
Mr. Frodo!

677
01:19:17,971 --> 01:19:19,808
Find the halfling!

678
01:19:21,392 --> 01:19:23,232
Find the halfling!

679
01:19:27,325 --> 01:19:28,925
Elendil!

680
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:36,983
Aragorn, go!

681
01:19:58,594 --> 01:19:59,895
Frodo!

682
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:02,113
Hide here. Quick!

683
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:04,310
Come on!

684
01:20:06,896 --> 01:20:08,896
What's he doing?

685
01:20:13,091 --> 01:20:15,091
He's leaving.

686
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:22,706
- No!
- Pippin!

687
01:20:27,802 --> 01:20:29,679
Run, Frodo. Go!

688
01:20:30,652 --> 01:20:32,241
Hey! Hey, you!

689
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:33,725
- Over here!
- Hey!

690
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:35,668
- Over here!
- This way!

691
01:20:46,586 --> 01:20:48,892
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

692
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:45,718
The horn of Gondor.

693
01:21:46,094 --> 01:21:47,658
Boromir.

694
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,190
Run!

695
01:26:03,276 --> 01:26:04,776
No.

696
01:26:08,805 --> 01:26:11,706
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

697
01:26:12,091 --> 01:26:14,091
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

698
01:26:15,944 --> 01:26:17,344
I let Frodo go.

699
01:26:18,191 --> 01:26:20,180
Then you did what I could not.

700
01:26:21,717 --> 01:26:24,301
I tried to take the ring from him.

701
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:29,312
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

702
01:26:29,987 --> 01:26:32,188
I did not see it.

703
01:26:32,499 --> 01:26:35,599
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

704
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,688
You fought bravely.

705
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:41,666
You have kept your honor.

706
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:43,926
Leave it.

707
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,532
It is over.

708
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:49,968
The world of men will fall...

709
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:52,961
...and all will come to darkness...

710
01:26:53,428 --> 01:26:56,228
...and my city to ruin.

711
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:02,922
I do not know what
strength is in my blood...

712
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:06,686
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

713
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:10,762
...nor our people fail.

714
01:27:12,009 --> 01:27:13,409
Our people.

715
01:27:17,156 --> 01:27:19,156
Our people.

716
01:27:40,932 --> 01:27:43,832
I would have followed you, my brother.

717
01:27:45,358 --> 01:27:47,258
My captain.

718
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,720
My king.

719
01:28:11,628 --> 01:28:13,728
Be at peace...

720
01:28:14,281 --> 01:28:16,081
...son of Gondor.

721
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,624
They will look for his
coming from the white tower.

722
01:28:36,787 --> 01:28:39,224
But he will not return.

723
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,994
Frodo!

724
01:29:24,435 --> 01:29:27,636
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

725
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:31,828
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

726
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:37,780
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

727
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:40,830
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

728
01:29:41,499 --> 01:29:43,730
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

729
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:48,631
<i>...is what to do with the
time that is given to you.</i>

730
01:30:17,986 --> 01:30:19,986
Frodo, no!

731
01:30:20,514 --> 01:30:21,714
Frodo!

732
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:25,020
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

733
01:30:28,807 --> 01:30:30,707
Go back, Sam!

734
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:34,435
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

735
01:30:35,021 --> 01:30:37,721
And I'm coming with you!

736
01:30:38,368 --> 01:30:40,668
You can't swim!

737
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,223
Sam!

738
01:30:51,929 --> 01:30:53,330
Sam!

739
01:31:34,082 --> 01:31:36,541
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

740
01:31:36,793 --> 01:31:40,893
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

741
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,200
And I don't mean to.

742
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:47,459
I don't mean to.

743
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:50,821
Oh Sam.

744
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:07,603
Come on.

745
01:32:35,846 --> 01:32:40,246
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

746
01:32:55,777 --> 01:33:00,248
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

747
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:08,910
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

748
01:33:20,723 --> 01:33:23,823
Not if we hold true to each other.

749
01:33:25,431 --> 01:33:29,731
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

750
01:33:30,811 --> 01:33:35,912
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

751
01:33:37,371 --> 01:33:39,271
We travel light.

752
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:41,598
Let us hunt some orc.

753
01:33:44,498 --> 01:33:46,680
Yes! Ha ha!

754
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,020
Mordor.

755
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,821
I hope the others find a safer road.

756
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,280
Strider will look after them.

757
01:34:15,384 --> 01:34:18,355
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

758
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:21,156
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

759
01:34:21,609 --> 01:34:23,309
We may.

760
01:34:25,316 --> 01:34:26,416
Sam...

761
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:32,510
...I'm glad you are with me.
