00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:26,625
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>Estel, le iôn adar lín...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Hope, you are your father’s son... ♫

3
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:34,747
{\an8} [Sindarin] ♫ <i>... û iôn naneth lín.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ ... not your mother’s child. ♫

4
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:39,021
[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

5
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,774
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

6
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,735
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

7
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,035
That you'd never escape your fate.

8
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:56,935
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

9
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:01,336
...but only you have the power to wield it.

10
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,936
I do not want that power.

11
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:07,736
I have never wanted it.

12
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:11,614
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

13
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:18,481
My old sword!
Sting.

14
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:19,785
Here, take it. Take it.

15
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,238
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

16
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:33,615
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

17
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:38,345
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

18
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:40,609
Here's a pretty thing.

19
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,245
Mithril.

20
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,166
As light as a feather, and
as hard as dragon scales.

21
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:50,749
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

22
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,746
My old ring.

23
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:06,847
I should very much like...

24
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:11,047
...to hold it again, one last time.

25
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,599
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

26
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:36,636
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

27
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,403
I'm sorry for everything.

28
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,352
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

29
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,413
On you who travel with him, no oath...

30
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,653
...nor bond is laid to
go further than you will.

31
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,553
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

32
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,854
May the blessings of elves and men...

33
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:24,154
...and all free folk go with you.

34
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:31,155
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

35
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,429
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

36
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,944
Left.

37
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,464
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

38
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,465
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

39
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:26,465
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

40
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:30,366
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

41
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,366
Move your feet.

42
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,866
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

43
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,566
Faster!

44
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,567
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

45
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,467
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

46
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,456
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

47
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:52,468
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

48
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:58,068
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

49
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:08,669
Sorry!

50
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,869
Get him!

51
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:14,670
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

52
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,570
Gentlemen, that's enough.

53
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,241
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

54
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:26,207
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

55
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,703
It's moving fast.

56
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,471
Against the wind.

57
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,371
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

58
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,432
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

59
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,475
Spies of Saruman.

60
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,552
The passage south is being watched.

61
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,976
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

62
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,177
Frodo!

63
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,999
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>I tuo, i macil...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The strength, The weapon... ♫

64
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,479
Boromir.

65
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:00,979
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

66
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:06,248
{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Astaldoron mauri...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ The needs of the valiant... ♫

67
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,025
...over so small a thing.

{\an8} [Quenya] ♫ <i>Nai túren...</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ Be it that wictory... ♫

69
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,480
Such a little thing.

70
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,340
Boromir!

71
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,381
Give the ring to Frodo.

72
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,282
As you wish.

73
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,082
I care not.

74
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,093
So, Gandalf, you try to
lead them over Caradhras.

75
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,427
And if that fails...

76
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,086
... where then will you go?

77
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,187
If the mountain defeats you...

78
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:22,075
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

79
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:34,993
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

80
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,692
There is a fell voice on the air.

81
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,124
It's Saruman!

82
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,190
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

83
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,390
No!

84
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:02,776
[Sindarin] <i>Losto Caradhras, Sedho! Hodo!</i>
[English] Sleep Redhorn, Be still! Lie Still!

85
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,352
[Sindarin] <i>Nuitho i 'Ruith!</i>
[English] Hold your Wrath!

86
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:09,209
[Quenya] <i>Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!</i>
[English] Wake up cruel Redhorn!

87
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,977
[Quenya] <i>Nai yarvaxëa rasselya...</i>
[English] May your bloodstained horn...

88
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:17,302
[Quenya] <i>...taltuva ñotto-carinnar!</i>
[English] ...fall upon enemy heads!

89
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,966
We must get off the mountain!

90
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,772
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

91
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,272
The Gap of Rohan takes
us too close to Isengard!

92
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,897
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

93
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:19,632
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

94
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:26,062
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

95
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:30,670
The dwarves delved
too greedily and too deep.

96
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,999
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

97
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,700
Shadow and flame.

98
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:48,042
Let the ring-bearer decide.

99
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,991
We cannot stay here!

100
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,701
This will be the death of the hobbits.

101
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,601
Frodo?

102
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,402
We will go through the mines.

103
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,138
So be it.

104
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:18,236
Frodo, come and help an old man.

105
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,404
How is your shoulder?

106
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,540
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

107
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,109
You feel its power growing, don't you?

108
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,528
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

109
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:39,605
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

110
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,405
And, I fear, from within.

111
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:49,024
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

112
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,924
Trust your own strengths.

113
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,106
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

114
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,307
...for good or for evil.

115
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,807
Some are greater than I am.

116
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,807
And against some I
have not yet been tested.

117
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,047
The walls...

118
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,508
...of Moria.

119
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:18,209
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

120
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,838
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

121
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,709
Why doesn't that surprise me?

122
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,910
Well, let's see.

123
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,710
Ithildin.

124
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:42,611
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

125
00:13:56,812 --> 00:14:01,481
It reads; "The Doors
of Durin, Lord of Moria.

126
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:06,213
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

127
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,514
Oh It's quite simple.

128
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,313
If you are a friend, you speak the
password and the doors will open.

129
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:16,197
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

130
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:30,545
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

131
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,223
Nothing's happening.

132
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,492
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

133
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,217
...men and orcs.

134
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,538
- What are you going to do, then? 
- Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!

135
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,324
And if that does not shatter them...

136
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,218
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

137
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,217
...I will try to find the opening words.

138
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,229
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

139
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:11,729
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

140
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,829
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

141
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,220
Mines are no place for a pony.

142
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:20,788
Even one so brave as Bill.

143
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:22,907
Bye-bye, Bill.

144
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,275
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

145
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,520
Go on, Bill. Go on.

146
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,721
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

147
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,022
Do not disturb the water.

148
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,222
Oh, it's useless.

149
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:57,023
It's a riddle.

150
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:02,967
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

151
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,661
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

152
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,461
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

153
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:08,924
Mellon.

154
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:32,090
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

155
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,534
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

156
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:43,215
This, my friend, is the
home of my cousin Balin.

157
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,428
And they call it a mine.

158
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,051
A mine!

159
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:52,253
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

160
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,846
No....

161
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,529
No!

162
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,730
Goblins.

163
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,830
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

164
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,866
Now, get out of here. Get out!

165
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,731
- Frodo!
- Help!

166
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,631
Strider!

167
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,432
- Help!
- Get off him!

168
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:30,011
Aragorn!

169
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,529
Frodo!

170
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,128
Into the mines!

171
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:11,936
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

172
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,036
Run!

173
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,945
We now have but one choice.

174
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:43,438
We must face the long dark of Moria.

175
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,944
Be on your guard.

176
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:50,081
There are older and
fouler things than orcs...

177
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:53,139
...in the deep places of the world.

178
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:04,940
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

179
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:09,041
Let us hope that our
presence may go unnoticed.

180
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,545
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

181
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,246
...or jewels...

182
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,441
...but mithril.

183
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:27,548
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

184
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,848
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

185
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,949
I never told him...

186
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,949
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

187
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,150
Pippin.

188
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:16,353
I have no memory of this place.

189
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,657
- Are we Lost?
- No.

190
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,653
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

191
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,628
- Merry?
- What?

192
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:26,453
I'm hungry.

193
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,763
There's something down there.

194
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:42,154
It's Gollum.

195
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,082
Gollum?

196
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:46,455
He's been following
us for three days.

197
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,665
He escaped the
dungeons of Barad-dûr?

198
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,285
Escaped...

199
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:53,356
...or was set loose.

200
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,456
But now the ring has brought him here.

201
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,857
He will never be rid of his need for it.

202
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:08,657
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

203
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:13,027
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

204
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:19,858
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

205
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:23,759
Before it drove him mad.

206
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,859
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

207
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,722
Pity?

208
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,260
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

209
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:38,473
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

210
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:42,626
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

211
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,661
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

212
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,761
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

213
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:58,162
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

214
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,962
...before this is over.

215
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:07,263
The pity of Bilbo may
rule the fate of many.

216
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,364
I wish the ring had never come to me.

217
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:20,864
I wish none of this had happened.

218
00:23:21,762 --> 00:23:26,777
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

219
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:32,265
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

220
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:37,766
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

221
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:40,943
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

222
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,466
In which case, you also
were meant to have it.

223
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,867
And that is an encouraging thought.

224
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:55,767
It's that way.

225
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,267
- He's remembered.
- No.

226
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,862
But the air doesn't
smell so foul down here.

227
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:07,094
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

228
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,570
Let me risk a little more light.

229
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,371
Behold...

230
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,971
...the great realm and
dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

231
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:44,872
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

232
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:11,674
Gimli!

233
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,675
No!

234
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,376
Oh, no.

235
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:29,706
No.

236
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,777
"Here lies Balin...

237
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:41,277
...son of Fundin...

238
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,800
...Lord of Moria."

239
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:47,021
He is dead, then.

240
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:50,503
It's as I feared.

241
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:11,762
We must move on. We cannot linger.

242
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:16,285
"They have taken the
bridge and the second hall.

243
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
We have barred the gates...

244
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,181
...but cannot hold them for long.

245
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:26,181
The ground shakes.

246
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:28,181
Drums...

247
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,882
...drums in the deep.

248
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,582
We cannot get out.

249
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:43,383
A shadow moves in the dark.

250
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,683
We cannot get out.

251
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,583
They are coming."

252
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,588
Fool of a Took!

253
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,588
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

254
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,391
Frodo!

255
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,191
Orcs.

256
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,439
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

257
00:28:29,715 --> 00:28:31,193
They have a cave-troll.

258
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,412
Let them come!

259
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,994
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

260
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,038
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

261
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,308
Frodo!

262
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,611
Aragorn! Aragorn!

263
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,512
Frodo!

264
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:45,616
Frodo!

265
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,222
Oh, no.

266
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:57,423
He's alive.

267
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:02,823
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

268
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:05,223
You should be dead.

269
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:07,923
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

270
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:12,824
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

271
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,925
Mithril.

272
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:25,225
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

273
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:33,026
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

274
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:49,827
This way!

275
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:03,134
What is this new devilry?

276
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:22,136
A Balrog.

277
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:25,536
A demon of the ancient world.

278
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:30,137
This foe is beyond any of you.

279
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:32,937
Run!

280
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:41,738
Quickly!

281
00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,739
Gandalf.

282
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:01,839
Lead them on, Aragorn.

283
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,840
The bridge is near.

284
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

285
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,743
Gandalf!

286
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,345
Merry! Pippin!

287
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:14,946
Sam!

288
00:38:17,746 --> 00:38:20,847
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

289
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,447
Not the beard!

290
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,649
Steady.

291
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:44,249
Hold on!

292
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:06,651
Hang on!

293
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,052
Lean forward!

294
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,052
Steady.

295
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:25,553
Come on!

296
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,253
Now!

297
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,155
Over the bridge!

298
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:47,955
Fly!

299
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:34,659
You cannot pass!

300
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,559
Gandalf!

301
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,560
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

302
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,360
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

303
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,462
Go back to the Shadow.

304
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:14,563
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

305
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:45,566
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

306
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:55,767
Fly, you fools!

307
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:02,067
No!

308
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:10,368
Aragorn!

309
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:10,573
Legolas, get them up.

310
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:16,474
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

311
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:20,274
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

312
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:23,775
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

313
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:28,075
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

314
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,875
On your feet, Sam.

315
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,676
Frodo?

316
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,376
Frodo!

Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

Speak words we can all understand!

00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:59,689
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

345
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,390
That was not so courteous.

346
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:21,891
You bring great evil with you.

347
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:25,991

Nor would he have you give up hope.

356
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:13,796
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

357
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:17,896
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

358
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
You will follow me.

I can no longer see him from afar.

372
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:34,309
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

373
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:37,109
He has fallen into shadow.

374

For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

377
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:01,111
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

What now becomes of this fellowship?

385
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:47,915
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

386
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:54,216
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

387
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:57,316
Stray but a little and it will fail...

388

you from unfriendly eyes.

505
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,480
Lembas.

506
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,380
Elvish waybread.

507
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,680
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

508
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,181
How many did you eat?

509
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:44,981
Four.

510
01:02:50,882 --> 01:02:53,382
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

511
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:57,583
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

512
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,383
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

513
01:03:00,683 --> 01:03:04,383
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

514
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:09,584
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

515
01:03:18,014 --> 01:03:20,159
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

516
01:03:22,485 --> 01:03:26,885
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

517
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:48,987
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

518
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:52,688
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

519
01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:00,688
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

520
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:04,789
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

521
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:07,289
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

522
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:10,689
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

523
01:04:12,689 --> 01:04:14,690
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

524
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,590
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

525
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,790
Thank you, my lady.

526
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,891
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

527
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:34,291
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

528
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:36,792
Nothing.

529
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:40,692
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

530
01:04:41,392 --> 01:04:46,393
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

531
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:55,093
Actually....

532
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:56,994
There was one thing.

533
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,394
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

534
01:05:00,694 --> 01:05:03,394
Stupid to ask.

535
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:08,095
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

536
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,795
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

537
01:05:12,498 --> 01:05:13,541
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

538
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:20,073
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

539
01:05:21,224 --> 01:05:23,061
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

540
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:28,107
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

541
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:36,823
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

542
01:05:37,297 --> 01:05:40,197
That choice is yet before her.

543
01:05:41,098 --> 01:05:43,898
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

544
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:49,798
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

545
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:54,499
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

546
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:02,620
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

547
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:09,777
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

548
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:13,578
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

549
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:19,721
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

550
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:25,402
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

551
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:28,902
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

552
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:32,102
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

553
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:45,503
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

554
01:06:45,904 --> 01:06:49,904
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

555
01:06:59,005 --> 01:07:02,005
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

556
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:06,805
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

557
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:11,006
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

558
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,306
What was her gift?

559
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:18,306
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

560
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:22,007
She gave me three.

561
01:09:04,316 --> 01:09:07,617
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

562
01:09:11,517 --> 01:09:14,417
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

563
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,817
But he's too clever a waterman.

564
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:22,018
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

565
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:24,318
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

566
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,618
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

567
01:09:26,918 --> 01:09:29,919
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

568
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,219
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

569
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:37,119
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

570
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:38,519
But you're not.

571
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:41,420
I'm here to help you.

572
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,220
I promised Gandalf that I would.

573
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,821
You can't help me, Sam.

574
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,821
Not this time.

575
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,821
Get some sleep.

576
01:10:07,222 --> 01:10:09,322
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

577
01:10:09,922 --> 01:10:12,523
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

578
01:10:13,323 --> 01:10:15,423
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

579
01:10:15,823 --> 01:10:18,523
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

580
01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:21,123
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

581
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:25,824
Have you so little faith in your own people?

582
01:10:25,824 --> 01:10:28,824
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

583
01:10:29,224 --> 01:10:32,424
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

584
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:34,825
But you will not see that.

585
01:10:35,325 --> 01:10:36,625
You are afraid!

586
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,425
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

587
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:43,125
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

588
01:10:45,726 --> 01:10:49,926
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

589
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:03,227
Frodo.

590
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,527
The Argonath.

We cross the lake at nightfall.

596
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:40,336
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

597
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:43,936
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

598
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:48,237
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

599
01:12:48,537 --> 01:12:51,637
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

600
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:54,937
And after that, it gets even better.

601
01:12:55,437 --> 01:13:00,138
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

602
01:13:00,638 --> 01:13:01,938
That is our road.

603
01:13:03,538 --> 01:13:06,639
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

604
01:13:06,939 --> 01:13:08,539
Recover my...

605
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:13,539
- We should Leave now.
- No.

606
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:18,040
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

607
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,840
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

608
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,940
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

609
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,641
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

610
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:37,541
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

611
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:39,942
Where's Frodo?

612
01:14:05,644 --> 01:14:07,544
None of us should wander alone.

613
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,944
You, least of all.

614
01:14:11,244 --> 01:14:13,545
So much depends on you.

615
01:14:14,745 --> 01:14:16,645
Frodo?

616
01:14:23,846 --> 01:14:26,346
I know why you seek solitude.

617
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:30,446
You suffer. I see it day by day.

618
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:34,347
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

619
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:38,647
There are other ways, Frodo.

620
01:14:38,947 --> 01:14:42,647
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

621
01:14:42,947 --> 01:14:46,548
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

622
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:49,948
Warning...against what?

623
01:14:50,248 --> 01:14:52,248
We're all afraid, Frodo.

624
01:14:52,548 --> 01:14:56,049
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

625
01:14:56,449 --> 01:15:00,049
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

626
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:05,149
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

627
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,850
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

628
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:13,650
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

629
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,851
What chance do you think you have?

630
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:23,651
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

631
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:27,651
And you will beg for death before the end!

632
01:15:29,952 --> 01:15:31,952
You fool!

633
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:36,052
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

634
01:15:36,352 --> 01:15:39,053
It should be mine! Give it to me!

635
01:15:39,353 --> 01:15:40,553
- Give it to me!
- No!

636
01:15:40,853 --> 01:15:42,653
- Give it to me!
- No.

637
01:15:50,354 --> 01:15:52,254
I see your mind.

638
01:15:52,654 --> 01:15:55,454
You will take the ring to Sauron!

639
01:15:55,754 --> 01:15:57,554
You will betray us!

640
01:15:57,854 --> 01:16:00,955
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

641
01:16:01,455 --> 01:16:04,955
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

01:19:35,274 --> 01:19:36,774
Aragorn, go!

673
01:19:58,476 --> 01:19:59,777
Frodo!

674
01:20:00,377 --> 01:20:01,977
Hide here. Quick!

675
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:04,077
Come on!

676
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:08,577
What's he doing?

677
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:14,778
He's leaving.

678
01:20:19,678 --> 01:20:22,479
- No!
- Pippin!

679
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:29,679
Run, Frodo. Go!

680
01:20:30,379 --> 01:20:33,280
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

681
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,380
- Over here!
- This way!

682
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,581
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

683
01:21:43,986 --> 01:21:46,886
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

684
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,190
Run!

685
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,410
No.

686
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,411
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

687
01:26:11,711 --> 01:26:13,711
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

688
01:26:15,711 --> 01:26:17,111
I let Frodo go.

689
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:20,311
Then you did what I could not.

690
01:26:21,412 --> 01:26:24,612
I tried to take the ring from him.

691
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:29,312
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

692
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:31,913
I did not see it.

693
01:26:32,213 --> 01:26:35,313
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

694
01:26:35,913 --> 01:26:38,313
You fought bravely.

695
01:26:38,713 --> 01:26:41,213
You have kept your honor.

696
01:26:42,013 --> 01:26:43,714
Leave it.

697
01:26:44,214 --> 01:26:46,214
It is over.

698
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:52,614
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

699
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:56,015
...and my city to ruin.

700
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,915
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

701
01:27:02,915 --> 01:27:07,016
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

702
01:27:08,116 --> 01:27:10,516
...nor our people fail.

703
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:12,916
Our people.

704
01:27:16,817 --> 01:27:18,817
Our people.

705
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:43,519
I would have followed you, my brother.

706
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:47,119
My captain.

707
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,720
My king.

708
01:28:11,422 --> 01:28:13,522
Be at peace...

709
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,922
...son of Gondor.

710
01:28:32,424 --> 01:28:35,624
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

711
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:39,224
But he will not return.

712
01:29:02,626 --> 01:29:04,527
Frodo!

713
01:29:24,028 --> 01:29:27,229
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

714
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:31,329
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

715
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:37,230
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

716
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,830
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

717
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:43,730
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

718
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:48,631
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

719
01:30:17,533 --> 01:30:19,533
Frodo, no!

720
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:21,534
Frodo!

721
01:30:22,234 --> 01:30:24,834
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

722
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:30,434
Go back, Sam!

723
01:30:31,035 --> 01:30:34,435
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

724
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:37,435
And I'm coming with you!

725
01:30:38,135 --> 01:30:40,435
You can't swim!

726
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:45,936
Sam!

727
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:52,937
Sam!

728
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,541
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

729
01:31:36,941 --> 01:31:41,041
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

730
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:44,841
And I don't mean to.

731
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:47,342
I don't mean to.

732
01:31:49,142 --> 01:31:50,842
Oh Sam.

733
01:32:05,843 --> 01:32:07,443
Come on.

734
01:32:35,846 --> 01:32:40,246
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

735
01:32:55,348 --> 01:33:00,248
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

736
01:33:03,749 --> 01:33:08,449
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

737
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:23,550
Not if we hold true to each other.

738
01:33:25,051 --> 01:33:29,351
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

739
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:35,552
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

740
01:33:37,052 --> 01:33:38,952
We travel light.

741
01:33:39,252 --> 01:33:41,152
Let us hunt some orc.

742
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,152
Yes!

743
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:06,554
Mordor.

744
01:34:07,254 --> 01:34:10,455
I hope the others find a safer road.

745
01:34:11,555 --> 01:34:14,055
Strider will look after them.

746
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:18,355
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

747
01:34:18,855 --> 01:34:21,156
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

748
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,856
We may.

749
01:34:25,056 --> 01:34:26,156
Sam...

750
01:34:29,757 --> 01:34:32,257
...I'm glad you are with me.
