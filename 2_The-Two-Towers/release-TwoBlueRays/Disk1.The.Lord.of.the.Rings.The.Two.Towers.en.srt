4
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

5
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:31,121
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

6
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,124
Go back to the Shadow.

7
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:46,422
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,494
You shall not pass!

9
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,255
No! No!

10
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:25,560
Gandalf!

11
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:34,785
Fly, you fools.

12
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,290
No!

13
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,321
Gandalf!

14
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:51,925
Gandalf!

15
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,159
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

16
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,829
Nothing.

17
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,168
Just a dream.

18
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:22,551
Can you see the bottom?

19
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,954
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

20
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:39,934
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

21
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:45,014
Mr. Frodo!

22
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:49,346
I think I've found the bottom.

23
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:57,748
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

24
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:01,156
It's not natural. None of it.

25
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,324
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

26
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,760
Just a bit of seasoning.

27
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,168
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

28
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,937
Roast chicken?!

29
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:16,805
You never know.

30
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:20,213
Sam. My dear Sam.

31
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,852
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

32
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,112
It is special.

33
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,893
It's a little bit of home.

34
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,633
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

35
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:44,593
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,273
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

37
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,911
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,214
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

39
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:57,350
Won't come free in a hurry.

40
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,352
Real Elvish rope.

41
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:27,002
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

42
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,374
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

43
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,878
It's just where we can't get.

44
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,287
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

45
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:41,388
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

46
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,327
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

47
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,666
...but they did.

48
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,712
Mr. Frodo?

49
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,050
It's the Ring, isn't it?

50
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:11,621
It's getting heavier.

51
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,997
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

52
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:29,796
Oh, yes. Lovely.

53
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,737
Lembas bread. And look!

54
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,442
More lembas bread.

55
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:50,159
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

56
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,352
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

57
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,689
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

58
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,804
Those rain clouds might.

59
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:42,872
This looks strangely familiar.

60
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:45,969
It's because we've been here before.

61
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:48,707
We're going in circles.

62
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,315
What is that horrid stink?

63
00:08:51,486 --> 00:08:53,681
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

64
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,789
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

65
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,055
I can smell it.

66
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,732
We're not alone.

67
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,475
The thieves. The thieves.

68
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,609
The filthy little thieves.

69
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,449
Where is it?

70
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:33,320
Where is it?

71
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:37,224
They stole it from us.

72
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:41,628
My precious.

73
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:45,766
Curse them, we hates them!

74
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:50,034
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

75
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,927
This is Sting.

76
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,622
You've seen it before...

77
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,300
haven't you, Gollum?

78
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:58,864
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

79
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,654
It burns!

80
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:19,157
It burns us!

81
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,097
It freezes!

82
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,164
Nasty Elves twisted it.

83
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,997
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

84
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:36,674
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

85
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,440
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

86
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:43,207
That would kill us! Kill us!

87
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:46,082
It's no more than you deserve!

88
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,815
Maybe he does deserve to die.

89
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:55,664
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

90
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,969
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

91
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,970
Take it off us.

92
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,014
We swears to do what you wants.

93
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,116
We swears.

94
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,852
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

95
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,284
We swears...

96
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:28,290
to serve the master of the precious.

97
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,262
We will swear on...

98
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,401
on the precious.

99
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:36,763
Gollum. Gollum.

100
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:41,067
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

101
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,240
Yes...

102
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,302
on the precious.

103
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,116
On the precious.

104
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:53,776
I don't believe you!

105
00:12:55,823 --> 00:12:59,281
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

106
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,222
He's trying to trick us.

107
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:04,387
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

108
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:20,336
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

109
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:25,011
You've been there before?

110
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,610
Yes.

111
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,158
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

112
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:53,609
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

113
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,580
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

114
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,982
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

115
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:06,624
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

116
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:12,786
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

117
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,832
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

118
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:21,132
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

119
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:27,907
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

120
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,543
There! What did I tell you?

121
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:34,946
He's run off, the old villain.

122
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,642
So much for his promises.

123
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:39,412
This way, Hobbits.

124
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,714
Follow me!

125
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:56,971
Merry!

126
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:59,431
Merry!

127
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:08,714
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

128
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,715
He wants the Shire-rats now.

129
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:16,184
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

130
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:20,287
Saruman will have his prize.

131
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:23,660
We will deliver them.

132
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:31,237
Merry!

133
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,737
Merry? Wake up.

134
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,076
My friend is sick.

135
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:42,176
He needs water. Please!

136
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,886
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

137
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,785
Stop it!

138
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,623
Can't take his draught!

139
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,860
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

140
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:04,769
You want some?

141
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,873
Then keep your mouth shut.

142
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,305
Merry.

143
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,706
Hello, Pip.

144
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:20,987
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

145
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:23,646
- It was just an act.
- An act?

146
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,192
See? I fooled you too.

147
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,626
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

148
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,925
What is it? What do you smell?

149
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,200
Man-flesh.

150
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,706
They've picked up our trail.

151
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,936
Aragorn.

152
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,477
Let's move!

153
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:14,562
Their pace has quickened.

154
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:17,542
They must have caught our scent.

155
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,473
Hurry!

156
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:24,878
Come on, Gimli!

157
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,019
Three days and nights pursuit.

158
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,159
No food. No rest.

159
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:38,318
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

160
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:12,923
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

161
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:16,630
They may yet be alive.

162
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:20,096
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

163
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,197
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

164
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,675
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

165
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:33,479
Very dangerous over short distances.

166
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,957
Rohan.

167
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,927
Home of the Horse-lords.

168
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,693
There's something strange at work here.

169
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,839
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

170
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,975
Sets its will against us.

171
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,048
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

172
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:10,777
The Uruks turn northeast.

173
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,781
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

174
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:15,918
Saruman.

175
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:27,529
The world is changing.

176
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:33,299
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

177
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,739
and Mordor?

178
00:19:38,446 --> 00:19:44,077
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

179
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,880
and the union of the two towers?

180
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,364
Together, my Lord Sauron...

181
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,058
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

182
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:21,417
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

183
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,253
The forests will fall.

184
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,027
A new order will rise.

185
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:36,000
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

186
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,128
and the iron fists of the Orc.

187
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,882
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

188
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,681
But, my lord, there are too many!

189
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,882
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

190
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,119
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

191
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,129
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

192
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,766
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

193
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,538
- Burn it.
- Yes.

194
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,573
We will fight for you.

195
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,713
Swear it.

196
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,990
We will die for Saruman.

197
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:40,086
The Horse-Men took your lands.

198
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:44,792
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

199
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,402
Murderers!

200
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:49,430
Take back the lands they stole from you.

201
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:51,402
Burn every village!

202
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:59,775
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

203
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,775
It will begin in Rohan.

204
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,047
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

205
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:09,020
But no more.

206
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:11,456
Eothain! Eothain!

207
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,292
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

208
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,328
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

209
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,163
He is too big for him.

210
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,340
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

211
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,032
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

212
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:30,244
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

213
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:34,144
Freda, I will find you there.

214
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:40,750
Quickly!

215
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,720
Go, child.

216
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,509
Rohan, my lord...

217
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:06,708
is ready to fall.

218
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,483
Theodred.

219
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:21,321
Find the king's son!

220
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,809
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

221
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,552
My Lord Eomer, over here!

222
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,160
He's alive.

223
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:31,054
Theodred.

224
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:47,469
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

225
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,371
He was ambushed by Orcs.

226
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:55,546
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

227
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:58,411
That is a lie.

228
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:05,426
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

229
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,089
Grima.

230
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,468
Grima.

231
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:16,495
Grima.

232
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,367
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

233
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:24,372
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

234
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,949
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

235
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:41,560
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

236
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:44,233
Can you not see?

237
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:49,429
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

238
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,165
your warmongering.

239
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:56,346
Warmongering?

240
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,674
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

241
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,881
What was the promised price, Grima?

242
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:05,713
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

243
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,828
Too long have you watched my sister.

244
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,005
Too long have you haunted her steps.

245
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,413
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

246
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,743
Too much.

247
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:43,888
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

248
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:48,860
and all its domains under pain of death.

249
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:51,663
You have no authority here.

250
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,301
Your orders mean nothing.

251
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:58,670
This order does not come from me.

252
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,001
It comes from the king.

253
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:04,202
He signed it this morning.

254
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,471
Keep breathing. That's the key.

255
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,406
Breathe.

256
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:48,351
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

257
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:06,529
We're not going no further...

258
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:08,696
until we've had a breather.

259
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,209
Get a fire going!

260
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,838
Merry!

261
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:18,546
Merry!

262
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:25,451
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

263
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:37,128
What's making that noise?

264
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,170
It's the trees.

265
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:41,964
What?

266
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:46,141
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

267
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:50,804
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

268
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,505
and come alive.

269
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,445
Alive?

270
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,014
Trees that could whisper...

271
00:28:58,022 --> 00:29:00,490
talk to each other...

272
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,455
even move.

273
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:06,325
I'm starving.

274
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:10,557
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

275
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:12,196
Yeah!

276
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:15,667
Why can't we have some meat?!

277
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,236
What about them?

278
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,310
They're fresh.

279
00:29:22,979 --> 00:29:26,745
They are not for eating.

280
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:34,690
What about their legs?

281
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,189
They don't need those.

282
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:41,858
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

283
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:48,569
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

284
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,872
Alive?

285
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:58,109
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

286
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:03,883
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

287
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,078
The master wants it for the war.

288
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:11,857
They think we have the Ring.

289
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,460
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

290
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,298
Just a mouthful...

291
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,660
a bit of the flank.

292
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:30,035
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

293
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:37,913
Pippin.

294
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:39,780
Let's go.

295
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:49,719
Go on.

296
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,398
Call for help.

297
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,892
Squeal.

298
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,264
No one's going to save you now.

299
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,846
Pippin!

300
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:34,628
A red sun rises.

301
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,075
Blood has been spilled this night.

302
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,106
Riders of Rohan...

303
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,977
what news from the Mark?

304
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:46,141
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

305
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:48,205
Speak quickly!

306
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:53,209
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

307
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,884
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

308
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:07,695
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

309
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,791
You would die before your stroke fell.

310
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:21,409
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

311
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:25,942
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

312
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:29,346
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

313
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:34,852
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

314
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,285
Not even his own kin.

315
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:43,764
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

316
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:45,866
and claimed lordship over these lands.

317
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:50,828
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

318
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:52,768
And for that, we are banished.

319
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:58,142
The White Wizard is cunning.

320
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:01,213
He walks here and there, they say...

321
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,350
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

322
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:09,052
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

323
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:11,454
We are no spies.

324
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,561
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

325
00:34:14,863 --> 00:34:17,195
They have taken two of our friends captive.

326
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,467
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

327
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,798
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

328
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:26,940
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

329
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,268
We left none alive.

330
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,882
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

331
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,583
Dead?

332
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:47,286
I am sorry.

333
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:55,163
Hasufel! Arod!

334
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,633
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

335
00:35:02,842 --> 00:35:04,434
Farewell.

336
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,879
Look for your friends.

337
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,581
But do not trust to hope.

338
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,849
It has forsaken these lands.

339
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:21,049
We ride north!

340
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:13,473
It's one of their wee belts.

341
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:18,925
[Sindarin] <i>Hiro hyn hîdh ab ’wanath.</i>
[English] May they find peace after death.

342
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:29,316
We failed them.

343
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,534
A Hobbit lay here.

344
00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:49,070
And the other.

345
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,481
They crawled.

346
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,688
Their hands were bound.

347
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,672
Their bonds were cut.

348
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,285
They ran over here.

349
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,124
They were followed.

350
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,064
The belt!

351
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,100
Run!

352
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,176
Tracks lead away from the battle...

353
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,078
into Fangorn Forest.

354
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,421
Fangorn?

355
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,217
What madness drove them in there?

356
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,967
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

357
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:42,120
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

358
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,349
Come here!

359
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:57,427
Trees. Climb a tree.

360
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,474
He's gone.

361
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,891
Merry!

362
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,775
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

363
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,440
Run, Merry!

364
00:39:57,227 --> 00:40:01,561
Little Orcs.

365
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,064
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

366
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:06,134
Tree?

367
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,295
I am no tree!

368
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,700
I am an Ent.

369
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:14,402
A tree-herder.

370
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:16,946
A shepherd of the forest.

371
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,479
Don't talk to it, Merry.

372
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,449
Don't encourage it!

373
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,882
Treebeard, some call me.

374
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,023
And whose side are you on?

375
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,251
Side?

376
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,326
I am on nobody's side...

377
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:38,032
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

378
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:43,465
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

379
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,272
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

380
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:48,739
Hobbits?

381
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:54,847
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

382
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,544
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

383
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,849
They come with fire.

384
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:05,617
They come with axes.

385
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:10,628
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

386
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:14,632
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

387
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:17,702
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

388
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,703
Halflings!

389
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:20,966
Shire-folk!

390
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:23,508
Maybe you are...

391
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:27,441
and maybe you aren't.

392
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,452
The White Wizard will know.

393
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:35,188
The White Wizard?

394
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:38,214
Saruman.

395
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:52,465
See? See?

396
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:55,106
We've led you out.

397
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:57,765
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

398
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,348
Very lucky we find you.

399
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:11,751
Nice Hobbit.

400
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,925
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

401
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:20,725
A swamp, yes, yes.

402
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,199
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

403
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,977
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

404
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,876
I found it. I did.

405
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,746
The way through the marshes.

406
00:42:40,953 --> 00:42:44,445
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

407
00:42:44,657 --> 00:42:48,718
They go around for miles and miles.

408
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:50,361
Come quickly.

409
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:54,623
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

410
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,133
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

411
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:01,568
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

412
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,107
No, no birdses to eat.

413
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,574
No crunchable birdses.

414
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,047
We are famished! Yes!

415
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:17,517
Famished we are, precious!

416
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:33,993
Here.

417
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,196
What does it eats?

418
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:39,376
Is it tasty?

419
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:47,276
It tries to chokes us!

420
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:51,214
We can't eats Hobbit food!

421
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:56,949
We must starve!

422
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:59,492
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

423
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,458
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

424
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:05,498
It does not care if we be hungry.

425
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:10,468
Does not care if we should die.

426
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,940
Not like master.

427
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:17,404
Master cares.

428
00:44:18,581 --> 00:44:20,445
Master knows.

429
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:24,886
Yes.

430
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,681
Precious.

431
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:34,888
Once it takes hold of us...

432
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:40,929
it never lets go.

433
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:42,796
Don't touch me!

434
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:17,134
There are dead things!

435
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:19,067
Dead faces in the water.

436
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:27,870
All dead. All rotten.

437
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:32,147
Elves and Men and Orcses.

438
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:35,981
A great battle long ago.

439
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,519
Dead Marshes.

440
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:41,455
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

441
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,892
This way.

442
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:47,862
Don't follow the lights.

443
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:53,470
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

444
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:57,769
and light little candles of their own.

445
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:25,436
Frodo!

446
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:14,577
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

447
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:16,616
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

448
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:18,651
Are you all right?

449
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:50,520
So bright.

450
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,520
So beautiful.

451
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:58,558
Our precious.

452
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:01,519
What did you say?

453
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,891
Master should be resting.

454
00:48:04,066 --> 00:48:08,126
Master needs to keep up his strength.

455
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:13,369
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

456
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,031
Gollum. Gollum.

457
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,007
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

458
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:21,274
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

459
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:23,007
He said your life was a sad story.

460
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:27,746
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

461
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:30,914
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

462
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,854
Were you?

463
00:48:35,096 --> 00:48:37,326
Smeagol.

464
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,561
What did you call me?

465
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:48,671
That was your name once, wasn't it?

466
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,610
A long time ago.

467
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:54,608
My name.

468
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,173
My name.

469
00:49:04,058 --> 00:49:06,526
Smeagol.

470
00:49:10,663 --> 00:49:12,290
Black Riders!

471
00:49:12,465 --> 00:49:13,796
Hide! Hide!

472
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,675
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

473
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:30,475
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

474
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,912
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

475
00:49:34,086 --> 00:49:37,055
No, you cannot kill them. No.

476
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:05,308
Wraiths!

477
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,713
Wraiths on wings!

478
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:17,752
They are calling for it.

479
00:50:17,996 --> 00:50:21,522
They are calling for the precious.

480
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:25,794
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

481
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,231
I'm here.

482
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:44,777
Hurry, Hobbits.

483
00:50:45,356 --> 00:50:49,292
The Black Gate is very close.

484
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,031
Orc blood.

485
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:09,741
These are strange tracks.

486
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:13,039
The air is so close in here.

487
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:16,617
This forest is old.

488
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,411
Very old.

489
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,488
Full of memory...

490
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:28,427
and anger.

491
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:37,504
The trees are speaking to each other.

492
00:51:37,672 --> 00:51:39,162
Gimli!

493
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:41,275
Lower your ax.

494
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,843
They have feelings, my friend.

495
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:49,373
The Elves began it.

496
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:54,317
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

497
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,189
Talking trees.

498
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,852
What do trees have to talk about?

499
00:52:01,029 --> 00:52:04,192
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

500
00:52:07,212 --> 00:52:09,162
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nad no ennas!</i>
[English] A thing to be there!

501
00:52:15,947 --> 00:52:17,771
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What do you see?

502
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:20,579
The White Wizard approaches.

503
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:31,087
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

504
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:42,931
We must be quick.

505
00:52:58,518 --> 00:53:02,147
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

506
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,121
Where are they?

507
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,851
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

508
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:12,293
They met someone they did not expect.

509
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:14,592
Does that comfort you?

510
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:16,735
Who are you?

511
00:53:18,204 --> 00:53:20,172
Show yourself!

512
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,072
It cannot be.

513
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,019
Forgive me.

514
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:38,622
I mistook you for Saruman.

515
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,155
I am Saruman.

516
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:47,563
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

517
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:50,024
You fell.

518
00:53:51,503 --> 00:53:54,027
Through fire...

519
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:55,502
and water.

520
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,499
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

521
00:53:59,677 --> 00:54:03,374
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

522
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,960
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

523
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:26,592
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

524
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:35,169
Darkness took me...

525
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:40,007
and I strayed out of thought and time.

526
00:54:40,784 --> 00:54:43,844
Stars wheeled overhead...

527
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,614
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

528
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,887
But it was not the end.

529
00:54:53,129 --> 00:54:55,962
I felt life in me again.

530
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:00,426
I've been sent back...

531
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:02,162
until my task is done.

532
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,439
Gandalf.

533
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:07,098
Gandalf?

534
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:09,306
Yes.

535
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:13,911
That was what they used to call me.

536
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:19,049
Gandalf the Grey.

537
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:22,152
That was my name.

538
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:23,757
Gandalf.

539
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:27,787
I am Gandalf the White.

540
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:33,892
And I come back to you now...

541
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:36,559
at the turn of the tide.

542
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:40,641
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

543
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:44,572
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

544
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:47,538
That is no short distance!

545
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:51,046
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

546
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:53,312
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

547
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:56,924
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

548
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:59,082
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

549
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,424
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

550
00:56:06,034 --> 00:56:09,197
I mean, charming...

551
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,100
quite charming forest.

552
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,303
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

553
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:20,879
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

554
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,484
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

555
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:27,984
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

556
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:31,147
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

557
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:34,918
You still speak in riddles.

558
00:56:37,763 --> 00:56:44,168
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

559
00:56:44,336 --> 00:56:47,965
The Ents are going to wake up...

560
00:56:48,507 --> 00:56:53,001
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

561
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:54,939
Oh, that's good.

562
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:57,843
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

563
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:01,181
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

564
00:57:01,353 --> 00:57:04,948
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

565
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:08,855
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

566
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,582
That is one of the Mearas...

567
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:35,548
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

568
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,434
Shadowfax.

569
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:00,636
He is the lord of all horses...

570
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:06,147
and has been my friend through many dangers.

571
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:23,992
O rowan mine

572
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,968
I saw you shine

573
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:31,665
Upon a summer's day

574
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:37,236
Upon your head How golden-red

575
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:42,178
The crown you bore aloft

576
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,750
Such a beautiful verse.

577
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,823
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

578
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:53,256
You might call it far, perhaps.

579
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:57,962
My home lies deep in the forest...

580
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:02,068
near the roots of the mountain.

581
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:07,001
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

582
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:11,201
And safe is where I'll keep you.

583
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:15,848
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

584
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:19,243
It's one of my own compositions.

585
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:20,615
Right.

586
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:26,921
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

587
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:31,964
And the dreams of trees unfold

588
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:38,595
When woodland halls are green and cool

589
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:42,867
And the wind is in the West

590
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:46,006
Come back to me

591
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:51,007
Come back to me

592
00:59:51,185 --> 00:59:57,612
And say my land is best

593
01:00:05,064 --> 01:00:08,727
Sleep, little Shirelings.

594
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:12,497
Heed no nightly noise.

595
01:00:12,705 --> 01:00:16,607
Sleep till morning light.

596
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:22,408
I have business in the forest.

597
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:28,111
There are many to call. Many that must come.

598
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:34,019
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

599
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:40,029
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

600
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:53,740
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

601
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:57,140
Sauron will suffer no rival.

602
01:00:57,582 --> 01:01:01,848
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

603
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,386
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

604
01:01:06,424 --> 01:01:08,392
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

605
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,119
The rumor has reached him.

606
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,264
The heir of Numenor still lives.

607
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:18,065
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

608
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:21,564
He fears what you may become.

609
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,276
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

610
01:01:26,444 --> 01:01:30,073
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

611
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:31,737
War is coming.

612
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:35,477
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

613
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:38,087
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

614
01:01:38,255 --> 01:01:41,952
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

615
01:01:42,126 --> 01:01:45,220
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

616
01:01:45,396 --> 01:01:50,094
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

617
01:01:50,934 --> 01:01:53,061
But for all their cunning...

618
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:55,794
we have one advantage.

619
01:01:57,974 --> 01:02:00,534
The Ring remains hidden.

620
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:03,478
And that we should seek to destroy it...

621
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:06,615
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

622
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:10,516
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

623
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,177
in the hands of a Hobbit.

624
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:16,450
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

625
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,253
We must trust now in Frodo.

626
01:02:19,428 --> 01:02:21,259
Everything depends upon speed...

627
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,422
and the secrecy of his quest.

628
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:29,735
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

629
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:33,370
Frodo must finish this task alone.

630
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:36,441
He's not alone.

631
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:38,307
Sam went with him.

632
01:02:38,981 --> 01:02:40,175
Did he?

633
01:02:40,349 --> 01:02:44,979
Did he, indeed? Good.

634
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:48,021
Yes, very good.

635
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,933
The Black Gate of Mordor.

636
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:06,139
Oh, save us.

637
01:03:11,946 --> 01:03:15,177
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

638
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:21,878
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

639
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:25,492
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

640
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,888
I did.

641
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:37,660
That's it, then.

642
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,536
We can't get past that.

643
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:27,049
Look!

644
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:28,686
The gate.

645
01:04:28,854 --> 01:04:30,048
It's opening!

646
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:39,463
I can see a way down.

647
01:04:40,198 --> 01:04:42,291
Sam, no!

648
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:45,867
Master!

649
01:06:09,651 --> 01:06:13,178
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

650
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:17,118
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

651
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:19,424
- Now!
- No!

652
01:06:19,995 --> 01:06:21,963
No! No, master!

653
01:06:22,163 --> 01:06:25,132
They catch you! They catch you!

654
01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:28,994
Don't take it to him.

655
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,670
He wants the precious.

656
01:06:34,843 --> 01:06:37,869
Always he is looking for it.

657
01:06:38,046 --> 01:06:41,948
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

658
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:46,085
But we mustn't let him have it.

659
01:06:52,494 --> 01:06:54,587
No! There's another way.

660
01:06:54,796 --> 01:06:57,458
More secret. A dark way.

661
01:06:57,766 --> 01:07:01,429
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

662
01:07:01,903 --> 01:07:02,925
He's up to something.

663
01:07:03,536 --> 01:07:06,130
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

664
01:07:06,306 --> 01:07:09,036
Yes. There's a path...

665
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:11,699
and some stairs.

666
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:13,572
And then...

667
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:17,079
a tunnel.

668
01:07:31,097 --> 01:07:32,894
He's led us this far, Sam.

669
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:34,465
Mr. Frodo, no.

670
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:37,068
He's been true to his word.

671
01:07:41,941 --> 01:07:43,135
No.

672
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:46,905
Lead the way, Smeagol.

673
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:51,449
Good Smeagol always helps.

674
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:26,405
Hello?

675
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:30,878
Treebeard?

676
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:32,920
Where has he gone?

677
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:35,558
I had the loveliest dream last night.

678
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:38,889
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

679
01:08:39,063 --> 01:08:41,554
And we smoked all of it. And then...

680
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:44,000
you were sick.

681
01:08:45,603 --> 01:08:48,436
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

682
01:08:51,942 --> 01:08:53,876
Did you hear that?

683
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:02,350
There it is again.

684
01:09:03,287 --> 01:09:07,883
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

685
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:14,629
You just said something... Treeish.

686
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,791
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

687
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:28,206
You're taller.

688
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:30,234
- Who?
- You!

689
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:32,039
- Than what?
- Than me!

690
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,675
I've always been taller than you.

691
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:39,480
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

692
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:41,845
Please, Merry.

693
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:45,891
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

694
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:49,295
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

695
01:09:51,433 --> 01:09:53,697
3'8"!

696
01:09:55,637 --> 01:09:57,468
Three-foot-eight.

697
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,442
You did something.

698
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,842
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

699
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:12,252
Merry!

700
01:10:12,453 --> 01:10:14,785
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

701
01:10:14,956 --> 01:10:18,858
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

702
01:10:19,026 --> 01:10:21,187
Give me it back. Merry!

703
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,395
What's happening?!

704
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:26,733
It's got my leg!

705
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,558
Merry!

706
01:10:47,954 --> 01:10:49,546
Help!

707
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,194
Away with you.

708
01:10:58,365 --> 01:11:00,162
You should not be waking.

709
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:05,536
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

710
01:11:06,139 --> 01:11:08,699
Go to sleep.

711
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:10,907
Away with you.

712
01:11:11,077 --> 01:11:14,376
Come, the forest is waking up.

713
01:11:14,948 --> 01:11:16,881
It isn't safe.

714
01:11:19,552 --> 01:11:23,488
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

715
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:26,648
Anger festers in their hearts.

716
01:11:27,526 --> 01:11:29,153
Black are their thoughts.

717
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:31,853
Strong is their hate.

718
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:34,795
They will harm you if they can.

719
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:38,528
There are too few of us now.

720
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:42,697
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

721
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,970
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

722
01:11:46,145 --> 01:11:49,342
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

723
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:55,146
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

724
01:11:55,353 --> 01:12:00,586
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

725
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:02,257
Oh, I'm sorry.

726
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,296
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

727
01:12:06,464 --> 01:12:09,695
We lost them.

728
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:14,930
And now we cannot find them.

729
01:12:15,106 --> 01:12:21,340
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

730
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:24,293
Can't say that I have.

731
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:26,862
You, Pip?

732
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,740
What do they look like?

733
01:12:33,178 --> 01:12:37,842
I don't remember now.

734
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:58,168
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

735
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:01,565
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

736
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:05,140
whose mind is overthrown.

737
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:09,575
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

738
01:13:10,214 --> 01:13:13,377
My lord, your son...

739
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:15,746
he is dead.

740
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:19,052
My lord?

741
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:21,484
Uncle?

742
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:30,562
Will you not go to him?

743
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:36,103
Will you do nothing?

744
01:13:36,273 --> 01:13:38,241
Be careful what you say.

745
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:40,602
Do not look for welcome here.

746
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:08,798
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

747
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:11,132
What a tragedy for the king...

748
01:14:11,374 --> 01:14:14,342
to lose his only son and heir.

749
01:14:15,444 --> 01:14:19,972
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

750
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:25,051
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

751
01:14:25,219 --> 01:14:26,686
Leave me alone, snake!

752
01:14:28,156 --> 01:14:29,783
Oh, but you are alone.

753
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:36,193
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

754
01:14:36,364 --> 01:14:39,822
in the bitter watches of the night...

755
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:43,664
when all your life seems to shrink.

756
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:48,069
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

757
01:14:48,242 --> 01:14:52,804
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

758
01:14:55,049 --> 01:14:56,949
So fair.

759
01:14:58,219 --> 01:14:59,584
So cold.

760
01:15:01,356 --> 01:15:03,517
Like a morning of pale spring...

761
01:15:03,725 --> 01:15:07,161
still clinging to winter's chill.

762
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:23,433
Your words are poison.

763
01:16:55,999 --> 01:16:58,467
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

764
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:16,616
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

765
01:17:18,122 --> 01:17:20,682
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

766
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,803
Your staff.

767
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:46,704
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

768
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,367
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

769
01:18:16,678 --> 01:18:18,236
He's a herald of woe.

770
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:22,850
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

771
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:25,385
Theoden King.

772
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:28,612
He's not welcome.

773
01:18:29,558 --> 01:18:34,894
Why should I welcome you...

774
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:39,059
Gandalf Stormcrow?

775
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:42,532
A just question, my liege.

776
01:18:42,703 --> 01:18:45,570
Late is the hour...

777
01:18:45,739 --> 01:18:49,698
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

778
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:52,570
Lathspell I name him.

779
01:18:52,746 --> 01:18:55,647
Ill news is an ill guest.

780
01:18:55,816 --> 01:19:00,377
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

781
01:19:00,553 --> 01:19:02,487
I have not passed through fire and death...

782
01:19:02,589 --> 01:19:05,820
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

783
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:08,919
His staff.

784
01:19:09,128 --> 01:19:13,258
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

785
01:19:16,603 --> 01:19:18,537
Theoden...

786
01:19:19,105 --> 01:19:21,665
son of Thengel...

787
01:19:23,443 --> 01:19:25,809
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

788
01:19:28,781 --> 01:19:32,046
I would stay still if I were you.

789
01:19:32,218 --> 01:19:34,311
Hearken to me!

790
01:19:39,826 --> 01:19:41,952
I release you...

791
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,128
from the spell.

792
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:58,700
You have no power here...

793
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:02,506
Gandalf the Grey.

794
01:20:07,919 --> 01:20:12,981
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

795
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:23,957
Wait.

796
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:29,237
If I go, Theoden dies.

797
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,135
You did not kill me...

798
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:34,505
you will not kill him.

799
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,111
Rohan is mine.

800
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:42,916
Be gone.

801
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,556
I know your face.

802
01:21:34,136 --> 01:21:35,398
Eowyn.

803
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:38,968
Eowyn.

804
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:48,442
Gandalf?

805
01:21:48,983 --> 01:21:51,850
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

806
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,793
Dark have been my dreams of late.

807
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:15,705
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

808
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,846
if they grasped your sword.

809
01:23:03,956 --> 01:23:05,924
I've only...

810
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:09,185
ever served you, my lord.

811
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:14,355
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

812
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:17,301
Send me not from your sight.

813
01:23:19,605 --> 01:23:22,335
No, my lord! No, my lord.

814
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,735
Let him go.

815
01:23:24,443 --> 01:23:27,674
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

816
01:23:36,822 --> 01:23:39,154
Get out of my way!

817
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:44,556
Hail, Theoden King!

818
01:24:09,152 --> 01:24:11,643
Where is Theodred?

819
01:24:14,691 --> 01:24:17,251
Where is my son?

820

Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.

827
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:01,761
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

828
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:07,699
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

829
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:12,871
The young perish and the old linger.

830
01:26:13,473 --> 01:26:15,566
That I should live...

831
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:19,109
to see the last days of my house.

832
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:24,248
Theodred's death was not of your making.

833
01:26:27,286 --> 01:26:30,687
No parent should have to bury their child.

834
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:49,272
He was strong in life.

835
01:26:50,376 --> 01:26:53,937
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

[English] Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.

838
01:27:38,556 --> 01:27:40,456
They had no warning.

839
01:27:40,624 --> 01:27:43,024
They were unarmed.

840
01:27:43,494 --> 01:27:47,521
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

841
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:50,434
Rick, cot and tree.

842
01:27:50,735 --> 01:27:52,965
Where is Mama?

843
01:27:53,738 --> 01:27:57,970
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

844
01:27:58,175 --> 01:28:02,509
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

845
01:28:04,115 --> 01:28:07,083
Ride out and meet him head on.

846
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:11,343
Draw him away from your women and children.

847
01:28:11,688 --> 01:28:13,315
You must fight.

848
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:17,324
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

849
01:28:17,494 --> 01:28:19,121
Eomer is loyal to you.

850
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:21,991
His men will return and fight for their king.

851
01:28:22,165 --> 01:28:26,067
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

852
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:31,969
Eomer cannot help us.

853
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:34,371
I know what it is you want of me...

854
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:37,841
but I will not bring further death to my people.

855
01:28:39,515 --> 01:28:41,210
I will not risk open war.

856
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:46,785
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

857
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,686
When last I looked...

858
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:56,757
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

859
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:05,836
Then what is the king's decision?

860
01:29:11,445 --> 01:29:12,776
By order of the king...

861
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,414
the city must empty.

862
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:18,450
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

863
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:22,655
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

864
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:24,347
Helm's Deep.

865
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:28,052
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

866
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,197
Who will defend them if not their king?

867
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:32,832
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

868
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,797
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

869
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:38,871
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

870
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,234
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

871
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:43,569
What they will get is a massacre.

872
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,613
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

873
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:51,848
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

874
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,186
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

875
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:58,453
The people of Rohan will need you.

876
01:29:58,825 --> 01:30:01,293
The defenses have to hold.

877
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:04,458
They will hold.

878
01:30:08,468 --> 01:30:10,766
The Grey Pilgrim.

879
01:30:10,937 --> 01:30:13,564
That's what they used to call me.

880
01:30:13,772 --> 01:30:18,835
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

881
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:22,674
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

882
01:30:23,215 --> 01:30:26,514
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

883
01:30:27,386 --> 01:30:30,082
At dawn, look to the east.

884
01:30:30,256 --> 01:30:31,814
Go.

885
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:02,483
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

His name is Brego.

895
01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:46,995
He was my cousin's horse.

896
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:49,027
Brego.

01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:02,879
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What did you see?

900
01:32:03,747 --> 01:32:06,147
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

901
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:09,614
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

902
01:32:10,653 --> 01:32:13,087
You speak as one of their own.

903
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:17,324
I was raised in Rivendell...

904
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:19,116
for a time.

905
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,455
Turn this fellow free.

906
01:32:25,133 --> 01:32:27,601
He's seen enough of war.

907
01:32:39,381 --> 01:32:42,248
Gandalf the White.

908
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:44,783
Gandalf the Fool!

909
01:32:46,054 --> 01:32:50,115
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

910
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:55,295
There were three who followed the wizard.

911
01:32:55,697 --> 01:33:01,067
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

912
01:33:01,436 --> 01:33:04,166
You stink of horse.

913
01:33:09,444 --> 01:33:11,309
The Man...

914
01:33:13,348 --> 01:33:17,546
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

915
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:21,517
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

916
01:33:21,687 --> 01:33:23,484
His cloth was poor.

917
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:29,521
And yet he bore a strange ring.

918
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:34,157
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

919
01:33:34,367 --> 01:33:40,203
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

920
01:33:40,373 --> 01:33:42,273
The Ring of Barahir.

921
01:33:43,242 --> 01:33:46,837
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

922
01:33:47,013 --> 01:33:50,346
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

923
01:33:50,516 --> 01:33:53,246
The line was broken years ago.

924
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,144
It matters not.

925
01:33:56,322 --> 01:33:58,847
The world of Men shall fall.

926
01:33:59,025 --> 01:34:00,890
It will begin at Edoras.

927
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:12,003
I am ready, Gamling.

928
01:34:12,171 --> 01:34:14,639
Bring my horse.

929
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:19,175
This is not a defeat.

930
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:22,809
We will return.

931
01:34:28,253 --> 01:34:30,653
We will return.

932
01:34:54,078 --> 01:34:56,012
You have some skill with a blade.

933
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:06,548
Women of this country learned long ago:

934
01:35:06,724 --> 01:35:09,352
Those without swords can still die upon them.

935
01:35:09,527 --> 01:35:11,358
I fear neither death nor pain.

936
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:14,723
What do you fear, my lady?

937
01:35:18,135 --> 01:35:19,966
A cage.

938
01:35:21,272 --> 01:35:25,106
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

939
01:35:25,276 --> 01:35:29,177
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

940
01:35:32,615 --> 01:35:34,640
You're a daughter of kings...

941
01:35:35,919 --> 01:35:39,218
a shield maiden of Rohan.

942
01:35:44,527 --> 01:35:47,017
I do not think that would be your fate.

943
01:36:20,095 --> 01:36:23,087
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

944
01:36:23,298 --> 01:36:25,357
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

945
01:36:25,567 --> 01:36:28,468
He will expect an attack on the city.

946
01:36:29,771 --> 01:36:33,035
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

947
01:36:33,207 --> 01:36:35,539
the great fortress of Rohan.

948
01:36:36,744 --> 01:36:41,147
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

949
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:44,312
They will be slow.

950
01:36:44,685 --> 01:36:49,122
They will have women and children with them.

951
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:55,257
Send out your Warg-riders.

952
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:13,011
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

953
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:15,841
- Why do you do that?
- What?

954
01:37:16,016 --> 01:37:18,541
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

955
01:37:18,985 --> 01:37:21,010
Because.

956
01:37:22,555 --> 01:37:24,682
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

957
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:27,052
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

958
01:37:27,527 --> 01:37:30,291
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

959
01:37:30,463 --> 01:37:32,727
You have no idea what it did to him...

960
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:35,366
what it's still doing to him.

961
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,696
I want to help him, Sam.

962
01:37:39,872 --> 01:37:41,134
Why?

963
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:49,573
Because I have to believe he can come back.

964
01:37:53,819 --> 01:37:55,753
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

965
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:58,651
What do you know about it? Nothing!

966
01:38:05,564 --> 01:38:09,761
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

967
01:38:10,601 --> 01:38:11,727
I do.

968
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:15,636
It's the Ring.

969
01:38:16,207 --> 01:38:17,765
You can't take your eyes off it.

970
01:38:18,509 --> 01:38:20,477
I've seen you.

971
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:24,779
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

972
01:38:26,551 --> 01:38:28,781
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

973
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:31,649
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

974
01:38:31,856 --> 01:38:34,791
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

975
01:38:34,959 --> 01:38:36,654
Mine! My own!

976
01:38:37,527 --> 01:38:39,620
Can't you hear yourself?

977
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,491
Don't you know who you sound like?

978
01:38:51,775 --> 01:38:53,902
We wants it.

979
01:38:54,077 --> 01:38:56,773
We needs it.

980
01:38:56,947 --> 01:39:01,748
Must have the precious.

981
01:39:01,918 --> 01:39:05,285
They stole it from us.

982
01:39:05,489 --> 01:39:08,856
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

983
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:12,927
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

984
01:39:13,096 --> 01:39:16,361
No. Not master.

985
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:20,366
Yes, precious. False.

986
01:39:20,536 --> 01:39:25,030
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

987
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:28,643
Master's my friend.

988
01:39:28,811 --> 01:39:33,874
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

989
01:39:35,151 --> 01:39:37,642
Not listening. I'm not listening.

990
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:41,812
You're a liar and a thief.

991
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:44,014
No.

992
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:47,860
Murderer.

993
01:39:50,331 --> 01:39:51,355
Go away.

994
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:53,899
Go away?

995
01:39:55,904 --> 01:39:58,702
I hate you.

996
01:39:58,873 --> 01:40:01,273
I hate you.

997
01:40:01,576 --> 01:40:04,875
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

998
01:40:05,046 --> 01:40:06,877
I saved us.

999
01:40:07,048 --> 01:40:11,576
It was me. We survived because of me.

1000
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:16,382
Not anymore.

1001
01:40:17,759 --> 01:40:19,283
What did you say?

1002
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:25,230
Master looks after us now.

1003
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,892
We don't need you.

1004
01:40:29,604 --> 01:40:31,162
What?

1005
01:40:31,339 --> 01:40:33,101
Leave now...

1006
01:40:33,273 --> 01:40:37,073
and never come back.

1007
01:40:37,244 --> 01:40:38,268
No.

1008
01:40:38,779 --> 01:40:42,977
Leave now and never come back.

1009
01:40:45,618 --> 01:40:51,523
Leave now and never come back!

1010
01:41:03,436 --> 01:41:06,132
We told him to go away.

1011
01:41:06,305 --> 01:41:09,274
And away he goes, precious.

1012
01:41:09,442 --> 01:41:11,433
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1013
01:41:11,611 --> 01:41:13,442
Smeagol is free!

1014
01:41:18,317 --> 01:41:19,807
Look.

1015
01:41:20,019 --> 01:41:24,479
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

1016
01:41:34,033 --> 01:41:35,466
They are young.

1017
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:38,160
They are tender. They are nice.

1018
01:41:38,337 --> 01:41:41,864
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1019
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,168
You'll make him sick, you will...

1020
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:49,573
behaving like that.

1021
01:41:52,016 --> 01:41:54,746
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

1022
01:41:58,989 --> 01:42:00,513
What's it doing?

1023
01:42:01,258 --> 01:42:03,852
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1024
01:42:04,028 --> 01:42:06,223
It ruins it.

1025
01:42:06,397 --> 01:42:10,026
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1026
01:42:14,171 --> 01:42:16,731
What we need is a few good taters.

1027
01:42:17,608 --> 01:42:20,668
What's taters, precious?

1028
01:42:20,844 --> 01:42:22,573
What's taters? Eh?

1029
01:42:22,746 --> 01:42:24,475
Po-ta-toes.

1030
01:42:24,815 --> 01:42:28,046
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1031
01:42:29,587 --> 01:42:35,048
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1032
01:42:36,393 --> 01:42:38,293
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1033
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:40,824
Oh, yes, we could.

1034
01:42:40,998 --> 01:42:44,490
Spoil a nice fish.

1035
01:42:45,769 --> 01:42:48,397
Give it to us raw...

1036
01:42:48,572 --> 01:42:51,597
and wriggling.

1037
01:42:51,774 --> 01:42:54,902
You keep nasty chips.

1038
01:42:55,844 --> 01:42:57,903
You're hopeless.

1039
01:43:10,392 --> 01:43:11,882
Mr. Frodo?

1040
01:43:29,778 --> 01:43:32,440
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1041
01:43:32,648 --> 01:43:35,116
Servants of Sauron.

1042
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:38,078
They are called to Mordor.

1043
01:43:38,286 --> 01:43:41,278
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1044
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:44,653
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

1045
01:43:46,228 --> 01:43:49,891
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1046
01:43:50,065 --> 01:43:55,229
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

1047
01:43:55,503 --> 01:43:58,563
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1048
01:43:58,739 --> 01:43:59,967
Mr. Frodo.

1049
01:44:00,474 --> 01:44:02,101
Look.

1050
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,977
It's an oliphaunt.

1051
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:19,215
No one at home will believe this.

1052
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:32,235
Smeagol?

1053
01:45:12,611 --> 01:45:15,079
We've lingered here too long.

1054
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:19,413
Come on, Sam.

1055
01:45:32,897 --> 01:45:35,593
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1056
01:45:37,301 --> 01:45:42,398
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1057
01:45:42,573 --> 01:45:45,474
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1058
01:45:46,878 --> 01:45:50,245
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1059
01:45:50,414 --> 01:45:52,439
The enemy?

1060
01:45:54,552 --> 01:45:58,044
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1061
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:02,549
You wonder what his name is...

1062
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,324
where he came from.

1063
01:46:08,298 --> 01:46:10,732
And if he was really evil at heart.

1064
01:46:12,402 --> 01:46:15,860
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1065
01:46:17,474 --> 01:46:19,965
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1066
01:46:22,179 --> 01:46:23,669
in peace.

1067
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,276
War will make corpses of us all.

1068
01:46:30,453 --> 01:46:32,511
Bind their hands.
