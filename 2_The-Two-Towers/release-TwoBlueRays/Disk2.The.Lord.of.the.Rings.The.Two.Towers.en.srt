2
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:09,898
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

3
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,768
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

4
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:17,104
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

5
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,411
It's the beards.

6
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,741
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

7
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,784
that there are no Dwarf women...

8
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:29,219
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

9
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,756
which is, of course, ridiculous.

10
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,129
It's all right. Nobody panic.

11
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:43,627
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

12
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:49,372
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

13
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,407
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,878
Cut down by Orcs.

15
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:58,041
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

16
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:03,281
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

17
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:08,018
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

18
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,403
Gimli.

19
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:22,632
No, I couldn't

20
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,640
I really couldn't.

21
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,775
I made some stew.

22
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:34,215
It isn't much, but it's hot.

23
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,086
Thank you.

24
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,108
- It's good.
- Really?

25
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,456
My uncle told me a strange thing.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,821
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

27
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,733
But he must be mistaken.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,404
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

29
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,737
Then you must be at least 60.

30
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,403
Seventy?

31
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,509
But you cannot be 80!

32
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,217
Eighty-seven.

33
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,416
You are one of the Dunedain.

34
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:51,586
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,458
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

36
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,896
There are few of us left.

37
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,832
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

38
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:05,007
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

39
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,786
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

40
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:28,030
It is mine to give to whom I will.

41
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,266
Like my heart.

42
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:36,399
Go to sleep.

43
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:49,415

44
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:39,064
I am asleep.

45
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,482
This is a dream.

46
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:52,916
Then it is a good dream.

65
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,751
The woman who gave you that jewel.

66
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:12,820
Our time here is ending.

67
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,051
Arwen's time is ending.

68
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,091
Let her go.

69
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,255
Let her take the ship into the west.

70
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,527
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

71
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,500
There it will be ever green.

72
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,372
But never more than memory.

73
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:33,669
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

74
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:37,475
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

75
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,948
She belongs with her people.

76
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,599
[Sindarin] <i>Nach gwannatha sin?</i>
[English] Are you going to leave in such way?

77
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:58,986
[Sindarin] <i>Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?</i>
[English] You would depart after the stars fade - unseen?

78
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:02,968
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-ethelithon.</i>
[English] I will not return.

79
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:06,068
[Sindarin] <i>Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.</i>
[English] Trust in your skill in battle.

80
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:07,968
[Sindarin] <i>Ethelithach.</i>
[English] You will return.

81
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:09,768
[Sindarin] <i> Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.</i>
[English] I don’t speak about death in battle.

82
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:12,068
[Sindarin] <i>O man pedich?</i>

00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:21,607
[Sindarin] <i>Edra le men, men na guil edwen...</i>
[English] A path is opened for you, a path to another life...

84
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:26,868
[Sindarin] <i>haer o auth a nîr a naeth.</i>
[English] ...far from war and weeping and woe.

85
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,097
Why are you saying this?

86
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,866
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

87
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:38,969
It was a dream, Arwen.

88
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,774
Nothing more.

89
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:45,377
I don't believe you.

90
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:56,222
This belongs to you.

91
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,554
It was a gift.

92
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,691
Keep it.

93
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,399
My lord?

94
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:15,770
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

95
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,735
What is it?

96
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,297
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

97
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,847
Wargs!

98
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,100
A scout!

99
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,937
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

100
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,478
Get them out of here!

101
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,248
All riders to the head of the column.

102
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,962
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

103
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,890
Come on!

104
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,141
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

105
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,811
- I can fight.
- No!

106
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,574
You must do this, for me.

107
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,178
Follow me!

108
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:13,023
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

109
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:15,891
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

110
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,400
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

111
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,764
That one counts as mine!

112
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,118
Stinking creature.

113
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,211
Aragorn!

114
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,418
Aragorn?

115
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:45,333
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

116
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:46,935
He's...

117
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,097
dead.

118
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,640
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

119
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,543
You lie.

120
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:33,039
Get the wounded on horses.

121
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:37,511
The wolves of Isengard will return.

122
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:40,046
Leave the dead.

123
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,986
Come.

124
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:00,698
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

125
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,777
There it is, Helm's Deep.

126
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:08,145
We're safe!

127
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,552
We're safe, my lady.

128
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,915
Thank you.

129
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,698
- Mama!
- Eothain!

130
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,357
Freda!

131
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,941
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

132
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:15,110
Take it to the caves.

133
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,148
Make way for the king.

134
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:22,985
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

135
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:34,628
So few. So few of you have returned.

136
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:39,668
Our people are safe.

137
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:43,567
We have paid for it with many lives.

138
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,935
My lady.

139
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,946
Lord Aragorn...

140
00:16:52,118 --> 00:16:53,346
where is he?

141
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:56,879
He fell.

142
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:22,514
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

143
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:25,616
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

144
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:28,944
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

145
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,715
Get them into the caves.

146
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:37,459
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

147
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:42,899
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

148
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,400
Its outer wall is solid rock...

149
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,665
but for a small culvert at its base...

150
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,604
which is little more than a drain.

151
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:58,643
How? How can fire undo stone?

152
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:03,310
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

153
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,918
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

154
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:14,622
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

155
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,360
thousands, to storm the Keep.

156
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:18,968
Tens of thousands.

157
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:23,198
But, my lord, there is no such force.

158
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:38,247
A new power is rising.

159
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,414
Its victory is at hand.

160
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,156
This night...

161
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,933
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

162
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:57,438
March to Helm's Deep!

163
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,044
Leave none alive!

164
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:06,048
To war!

165
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:14,447
There will be no dawn for Men.

166
00:19:31,642 --> 00:19:33,699
Look. There's smoke to the south.

167
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,038
There is always smoke rising...

168
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,114
from Isengard these days.

169
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,943
Isengard?

170
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,018
There was a time...

171
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:48,881
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

172
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:52,426
But now he has a mind of metal...

173
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,529
and wheels.

174
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,793
He no longer cares for growing things.

175
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,767
What is it?

176
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,971
It's Saruman's army.

177
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:11,703
The war has started.

178
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:54,453
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

179
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,585
Brego.

180
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:55,909
Arwen.

181
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,970
[Sindarin] <i>Tollen, i lû.</i>
[English] Come, it is time.

182
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,770
[Sindarin] <i>I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.</i>
[English] The ships depart to Valinor. Now go, before they sail.

183
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,488
I have made my choice.

184
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,800
He is not coming back.

185
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:21,570
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

186
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,478
There is still hope.

187
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,414
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

188
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,791
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

189
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,450
and all that you hope for comes true...

190
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:47,326
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

191
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,592
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

192
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,739
Aragorn will die.

193
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,100
And there will be no comfort for you...

194
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:03,474
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

195
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,015
He will come to death...

196
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,781
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

197
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:16,620
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

198
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,673
But you, my daughter...

199
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:35,535
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

200
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:39,774
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

201
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,586
Here you will dwell...

202
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,658
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

203
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,386
until all the world is changed...

204
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:58,059
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

205
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:07,737
Arwen.

206
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,647
There is nothing for you here...

207
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,413
only death.

208
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,670
[Sindarin] <i>Ah im, ú-’erin veleth lîn?</i>
[English] And I, I-have-not love your?

209
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,070
[Sindarin] <i>Gerich veleth nîn, ada.</i>
[English] You-have my love, father.

210
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,867
[Sindarin] <i>I amar prestar aen.</i>
[English] The world is changed.

211
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>
[English] I feel it in the water.

212
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,970
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>
[English] I feel it in the earth.

213
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,770
[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned ’wilith.</i>
[English] I smell it in the air.

214
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,509
The power of the enemy is growing.

215
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,312
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

216
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:02,854
to destroy the people of Rohan.

217
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:08,554
Isengard has been unleashed.

218
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,267
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

219
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:20,372
the last free kingdom of Men.

220
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:24,977
His war on this country will come swiftly.

221
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:31,775
He senses the Ring is close.

222
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:35,410
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

223
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:39,650
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

224
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:45,062
the quest will claim his life.

225
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,393
You know this.

226
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,867
You have foreseen it.

227
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:56,408
It is the risk we all took.

228
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:04,946
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

229
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,557
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

230
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:16,184
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

231
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:19,958
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

232
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:24,227
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

233
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:28,504
It is close now.

234
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:32,941
So close to achieving its goal.

235
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,679
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

236
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:43,982
even unto to the ending of the world.

237
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,656
The time of the Elves...

238
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:49,794
is over.

239
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,225
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

240
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:59,466
Do we let them stand alone?

241
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,374
What news?

242
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:08,343
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

243
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:11,381
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

244
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:15,578
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

245
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:18,154
Sauron is marshaling an army.

246
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,617
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

247
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:24,194
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

248
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:28,858
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

249
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:32,093
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

250
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,434
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

251
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:39,304
Sauron from Mordor.

252
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:43,843
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

253
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,709
Gondor is weak.

254
00:28:45,884 --> 00:28:49,011
Sauron will strike us soon.

255
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:51,619
And he will strike hard.

256
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:56,153
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

257
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,270
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

258
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:15,173
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

259
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:17,610
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

260
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,217
Speak.

261
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:29,917
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

262
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,287
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

263
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,221
Your bodyguard?

264
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,196
His gardener.

265
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,803
And where is your skulking friend?

266
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:43,636
That gangrel creature.

267
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:45,941
He had an ill-favored look.

268
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:49,577
There was no other.

269
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:56,016
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

270
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:02,415
One we lost in Moria...

271
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,017
two were my kin...

272
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:08,926
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

273
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:13,034
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

274
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,804
You're a friend of Boromir?

275
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,735
Yes.

276
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:25,906
For my part.

277
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:35,356
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

278
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:38,860
Dead?

279
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:41,086
How? When?

280
00:30:41,363 --> 00:30:43,990
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

281
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:48,167
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

282
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:57,368
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

283
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,673
It was cloven in two.

284
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:05,684
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

285
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:09,520
He was my brother.

286
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:01,441
Boromir!

287
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,841
Boromir!

288
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:11,847
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

289
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:15,681
A place of light and beauty and music.

290
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:18,187
And so it shall be once more!

291
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:23,389
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

292
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:27,965
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

293
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:37,437
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

294
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,778
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

295
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:42,778
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

296
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,255
Good speech. Nice and short.

297
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:57,361
Leaves more time for drinking!

298
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:01,861
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

299
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,466
Remember today, little brother.

300
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,632
Today, life is good.

301
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:16,405
What?

302
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:18,249
He's here.

303
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:23,285
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

304
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:24,478
Where is he?

305
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:28,114
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

306
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,388
Father!

307
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,633
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

308
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:41,203
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

309
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:45,575
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

310
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,675
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

311
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:50,872
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

312
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,744
Oh, too few.

313
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:55,651
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

314
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,847
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

315
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,288
That is not my intent.

316
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:07,260
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

317
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,535
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

318
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:16,468
I know his uses, and they are few.

319
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:20,235
We have more urgent things to speak of.

320
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:23,845
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

321
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:26,881
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

322
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,850
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

323
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,354
The One Ring.

324
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:42,792
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

325
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:46,595
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

326
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,900
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

327
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,370
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

328
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:59,241
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

329
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:03,318
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

330
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:08,788
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

331
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:14,019
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

332
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,697
He will return.

333
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:19,630
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

334
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,363
You must go.

335
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,632
Bring me back this mighty gift.

336
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:31,970
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

337
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:35,845
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

338
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,986
- send me in his stead.
- You?

339
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,123
Oh, I see.

340
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,488
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

341
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:48,897
I think not.

342
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,965
I trust this mission only to your brother.

343
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:55,034
The one who will not fail me.

344
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:15,284
Remember today, little brother.

345
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,666
Captain Faramir!

346
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:39,072
We found the third one.

347
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,560
You must come with me. Now.

348
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:04,863
Down there.

349
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,687
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

350
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,790
They wait for my command.

351
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:41,366
Shall I shoot?

352
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:45,635
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

353
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,643
So juicy sweet

354
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:51,251
Our only wish To catch a fish

355
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:54,113
So juicy sweet

356
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:02,492
Wait.

357
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:06,829
This creature is bound to me.

358
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:09,367
And I to him.

359
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:13,936
He is our guide.

360
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:20,078
Please...

361
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,111
let me go down to him.

362
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:35,087
Smeagol.

363
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:38,324
Master is here.

364
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:40,657
Come, Smeagol.

365
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:46,164
Trust master. Come.

366
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:53,175
We must go now?

367
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,982
Smeagol, you must trust master.

368
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,547
Follow me. Come on.

369
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,274
Come.

370
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:04,982
Come, Smeagol.

371
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,548
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

372
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,583
Come on.

373
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:15,693
Don't hurt him!

374
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:18,597
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

375
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,068
Master!

376
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:46,596
That's enough.

377
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,854
Where are you leading them?

378
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:56,509
Answer me.

379
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:00,302
Sméagol.

380
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:09,256
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

381
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:13,122
Cruel Men hurts us.

382
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:16,300
Master tricksed us.

383
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:20,062
Of course he did.

384
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:24,135
I told you he was tricksy.

385
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:27,334
I told you he was false.

386
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:30,208
Master is our friend.

387
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:32,747
Our friend.

388
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,078
Master betrayed us.

389
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:38,245
No. Not its business.

390
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:41,791
Leave us alone!

391
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:44,359
Filthy little Hobbitses!

392
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,827
They stole it from us!

393
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:48,431
No. No.

394
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,627
What did they steal?

395
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:58,106
My precious!

396
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:03,373
We have to get out of here.

397
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,949
You go. Go, now.

398
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,418
You can do it.

399
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:13,323
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

400
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:15,287
Just this once.

401
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:17,222
Put it on.

402
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:19,686
Disappear.

403
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:21,823
I can't.

404
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:27,166
You were right, Sam.

405
00:41:28,606 --> 00:41:31,097
You tried to tell me but...

406
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:37,974
I'm sorry.

407
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,387
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

408
00:41:46,824 --> 00:41:48,451
If I put it on...

409
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:50,991
he'll find me.

410
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,631
He'll see.

411
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:57,834
Mr. Frodo...

412
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:06,973
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

413
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,172
Here in the Wild I have you...

414
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,250
two Halflings...

415
00:42:14,418 --> 00:42:17,581
and a host of men at my call.

416
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:24,383
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

417
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:37,836
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

418
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:42,469
to show his quality.

419
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,159
No!

420
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:09,670
Stop it!

421
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,898
Leave him alone.

422
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,734
Don't you understand?

423
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:17,947
He's got to destroy it!

424
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:21,346
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

425
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,180
To the Mountain of Fire!

426
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:27,349
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

427
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:30,527
Please. It's such a burden.

428
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,789
Will you not help him?

429
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:38,067
Captain?

430
00:43:38,736 --> 00:43:40,966
Prepare to leave.

431
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,344
The Ring will go to Gondor.

432
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:53,572
[Sindarin] <i>Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.</i>
[English] Well done, Brego, my friend.

433
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:03,914
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

434
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,149
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

435
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,090
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

436
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:15,289
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

437
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,468
Bless you, laddie.

438
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:19,798
Gimli, where is the king?

439
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,023
[Sindarin] <i>Le abdollen.</i>
[English] You’re late.

440
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:34,916
You look terrible.

441
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:04,773
[Sindarin] <i>Hannon le.</i>
[English] Thank you.

442
00:46:16,661 --> 00:46:18,686
A great host, you say?

443
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:21,559
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

444
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:25,226
Ten thousand strong at least.

445
00:46:26,771 --> 00:46:28,204
Ten thousand?

446
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,131
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

447
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:35,939
To destroy the world of Men.

448
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,441
They will be here by nightfall.

449
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,588
Let them come!

450
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,857
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

451
00:46:52,063 --> 00:46:55,191
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

452
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,310
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

453
00:47:06,478 --> 00:47:08,912
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

454
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,810
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

455
00:47:11,983 --> 00:47:14,383
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

456
00:47:14,986 --> 00:47:17,181
These are Uruk-hai.

457
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:20,791
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

458
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,089
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

459
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:29,893
I know how to defend my own keep.

460
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:39,909
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

461
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:45,311
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

462
00:47:45,517 --> 00:47:48,179
Crops can be resown...

463
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:51,345
homes rebuilt.

464
00:47:51,957 --> 00:47:54,517
Within these walls...

465
00:47:54,926 --> 00:47:56,393
we will outlast them.

466
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:58,995
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

467
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:00,688
They come to destroy its people...

468
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:03,300
down to the last child.

469
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:06,466
What would you have me do?

470
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:08,367
Look at my men.

471
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,269
Their courage hangs by a thread.

472
00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:16,880
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

473
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:20,074
as to be worthy of remembrance.

474
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:25,622
Send out riders, my lord.

475
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:28,791
You must call for aid.

476
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,361
And who will come?

477
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:36,358
Elves?

478
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:38,593
Dwarves?

479
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:42,238
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

480
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:45,338
The old alliances are dead.

481
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:48,575
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

482
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:50,942
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

483
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:55,147
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

484
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,254
Where was Gon...?

485
00:48:59,924 --> 00:49:01,824
No, my Lord Aragorn...

486
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:05,896
we are alone.

487
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:14,500
Get the women and children into the caves.

488
00:49:14,673 --> 00:49:15,935
We need more time to lay provisions...

489
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:19,599
There is no time. War is upon us.

490
00:49:19,878 --> 00:49:21,573
Secure the gate.

491
00:49:26,785 --> 00:49:28,878
We Ents have not troubled...

492
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,454
about the wars of Men and wizards...

493
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:36,216
for a very long time.

494
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:42,262
But now, something is about to happen...

495
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:44,766
that has not happened...

496
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:47,437
for an age.

497
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,904
Entmoot.

498
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:52,331
What's that?

499
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:55,577
'Tis a gathering.

500
00:49:56,781 --> 00:49:59,341
A gathering of what?

501
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:19,668
Beech. Oak.

502
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:21,738
Chestnut. Ash.

503
00:50:22,006 --> 00:50:23,974
Good. Good. Good.

504
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,508
Many have come.

505
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:36,816
Now we must decide if the Ents...

506
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:39,548
will go to war.

507
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:51,593
Move back! Move to the caves!

508
00:50:54,072 --> 00:50:56,131
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

509
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,839
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

510
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,240
They can support the archers from above the gate.

511
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:04,540
Aragorn, you must rest.

512
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:07,116
You're no use to us half alive.

513
00:51:07,585 --> 00:51:08,779
Aragorn!

514
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,216
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

515
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,053
That is an honorable charge.

516
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:20,129
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

517
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:21,993
What renown is there in that?

518
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:25,864
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

519
00:51:26,137 --> 00:51:28,935
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

520
00:51:29,107 --> 00:51:34,101
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

521
00:51:34,412 --> 00:51:37,210
You do not command the others to stay!

522
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:41,148
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

523
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,515
Because they love you.

524
00:51:51,663 --> 00:51:53,153
I'm sorry.

525
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:02,328
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

526
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:05,198
These are no soldiers.

527
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:10,930
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

528
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,780
Look at them. They're frightened.

529
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:19,416
I can see it in their eyes.

530
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:26,273
[Sindarin] <i>Boe a hyn...</i>
[English] And they should be...

531
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:29,273
[Sindarin] <i>Neled herain... dan caer menig.</i>
[English] Three hundred... against ten thousand.

532
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,773
[Sindarin] <i>Si, beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.</i>
[English] Here they-will-defend them-selves sharper than at Edoras.

533
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:37,273
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nedin dagor hen ú-’erir ortheri.</i>
[English] Aragorn, in this battle they can not win.

534
00:53:38,773 --> 00:53:40,023
[Sindarin] <i>Natha daged dhaer</i>
[English] It will be great slaying.

535
00:53:40,405 --> 00:53:42,600
Then I shall die as one of them!

536
00:53:49,047 --> 00:53:50,878
Let him go, lad.

537
00:53:51,449 --> 00:53:53,417
Let him be.

538
00:53:54,886 --> 00:54:00,348
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

539
00:54:04,596 --> 00:54:06,496
My lord?

540
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,127
Who am I, Gamling?

541
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:18,408
You are our king, sire.

542
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:24,678
And do you trust your king?

543
00:54:26,218 --> 00:54:29,381
Your men, my lord...

544
00:54:29,555 --> 00:54:32,353
will follow you to whatever end.

545
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:41,164
To whatever end.

546
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,571
Where is the horse and the rider?

547
00:54:54,747 --> 00:54:57,807
Where is the horn that was blowing?

548
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:03,687
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

549
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,921
Like wind in the meadow.

550
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:15,396
The days have gone down in the West...

551
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:18,729
behind the hills...

552
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:22,266
into Shadow.

553
00:55:30,716 --> 00:55:34,152
How did it come to this?

554
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:57,339
It's been going for hours.

555
00:55:58,477 --> 00:56:00,843
They must have decided something by now.

556
00:56:01,013 --> 00:56:05,109
Decided? No.

557
00:56:05,284 --> 00:56:10,415
We only just finished saying...

558
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:13,488
good morning.

559
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,023
But it's nighttime already.

560
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,027
You can't take forever.

561
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,058
Don't be hasty.

562
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:25,935
We're running out of time!

563
00:56:28,941 --> 00:56:31,910
Move! Move to the outer wall.

564
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:50,792
Give me your sword.

565
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:01,431
What is your name?

566
00:57:01,974 --> 00:57:04,340
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

567
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:09,106
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

568
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:13,051
They say that it is hopeless.

569
00:57:30,903 --> 00:57:32,530
This is a good sword.

570
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:36,905
Haleth, son of Hama...

571
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:43,407
there is always hope.

572
00:58:06,338 --> 00:58:09,705
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

573
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,433
Forgive me.

574
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,043
I was wrong to despair.

575
00:58:15,974 --> 00:58:17,974
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-moe edaved, Legolas</i>
[English] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

576
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:25,052
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

577
00:58:28,527 --> 00:58:30,552
It's a little tight across the chest.

578
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:38,736
That is no Orc horn.

579
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:46,240
Send for the king.

580
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:50,006
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

581
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:23,308
How is this possible?

582
00:59:24,316 --> 00:59:27,945
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

583
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,351
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

584
00:59:32,057 --> 00:59:36,289
Long ago we fought and died together.

585
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:41,274
We come to honor that allegiance.

586
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:44,274
[Sindarin] <i>Mae govannen, Haldir.</i>
[English] Well-met, Haldir.

587
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:51,909
You are most welcome.

588
00:59:57,282 --> 01:00:01,218
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

589
01:00:34,886 --> 01:00:38,151
You could have picked a better spot.

590
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:47,225
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

591
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:55,202
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

592
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,332
Let's hope they last the night.

593
01:01:58,274 --> 01:02:01,274
[Sindarin] <i>A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...</i>
[English] O Children-of-Eru, don’t show mercy to them...

594
01:02:02,574 --> 01:02:05,574
[Sindarin] <i>...an uben tanatha le faelas!</i>
[English] ...for nobody will show you mercy!

595
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:42,542
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

596
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:45,612
Or would you like me to find you a box?

597
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:26,775
[Sindarin] <i>Dartho!</i>
[English] Hold!

598
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:50,611
So it begins.

599
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:58,275
[Sindarin] <i>Tangado a chadad!</i>
[English] Prepare to fire!

600
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,775
[Sindarin] <i>Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc...</i>
[English] Their armour is poor below the neck...

601
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:10,275
[Sindarin] <i>...a nu ranc!</i>
[English] ...and under arm!

602
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:12,525
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

603
01:04:17,443 --> 01:04:18,808
Did they hit anything?

604
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,469
Give them a volley.

605
01:04:21,647 --> 01:04:23,740
- Fire!
- Fire!

606
01:04:39,498 --> 01:04:41,193
Send them to me! Come on!

607
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,875
[Sindarin] <i>Pendraith!</i>
[English] Ladders!

608
01:05:01,887 --> 01:05:02,979
Good!

609
01:05:09,795 --> 01:05:12,764
Swords! Swords!

610
01:05:50,903 --> 01:05:53,030
Legolas! Two already!

611
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:55,332
I'm on 17!

612
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:58,068
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

613
01:06:04,817 --> 01:06:06,546
Nineteen!

614
01:06:32,545 --> 01:06:33,978
Merry.

615
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:42,184
We have just agreed.

616
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:53,698
Yes?

617
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:59,365
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

618
01:07:00,506 --> 01:07:03,669
and we have agreed...

619
01:07:04,143 --> 01:07:08,170
you are not Orcs.

620
01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:12,042
Well, that's good news.

621
01:07:12,218 --> 01:07:16,348
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

622
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:20,789
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

623
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,484
Hasty?

624
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:25,195
Our friends are out there.

625
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:29,528
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

626
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:32,133
War? Yes.

627
01:07:32,304 --> 01:07:34,204
It affects us all.

628
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:37,365
Tree, root and twig.

629
01:07:38,244 --> 01:07:42,271
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

630
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:44,415
it takes a long time...

631
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:49,486
to say anything in Old Entish...

632
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:53,887
and we never say anything...

633
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:57,995
unless it is worth taking...

634
01:07:58,164 --> 01:08:02,123
a long time to say.

635
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:06,234
Seventeen! Eighteen!

636
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:07,463
Nineteen!

637
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,905
Twenty!

638
01:08:10,075 --> 01:08:11,736
Twenty-one!

639
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:22,812
Causeway!

640
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:24,112
[Sindarin] <i>Na fennas!</i>
[English] To gateway!

641
01:08:24,175 --> 01:08:26,675
[Sindarin] <i>Hado ribed! Hado!</i>
[English] Hurl to flow! Hurl!

642
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:33,996
Is this it?

643
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:37,101
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

644
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:05,275
[Sindarin] <i>Togo hon dad, Legolas!</i>
[English] Bring him down, Legolas!

645
01:09:07,775 --> 01:09:08,775
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

646
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:10,775
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

647
01:10:03,088 --> 01:10:04,453
Brace the gate!

648
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:25,072
Hold them! Stand firm!

649
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:34,283
Aragorn!

650
01:10:38,924 --> 01:10:40,118
Gimli!

651
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,975
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

652
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:52,775
[Sindarin] <i>Herio!</i>
[English] Charge!

653
01:11:28,874 --> 01:11:32,810
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

654
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:37,606
We must weather such things as we have always done.

655
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,510
How can that be your decision?!

656
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:44,815
This is not our war.

657
01:11:45,124 --> 01:11:47,319
But you're part of this world!

658
01:11:51,497 --> 01:11:53,328
Aren't you?!

659
01:11:57,404 --> 01:11:59,770
You must help. Please.

660
01:12:01,007 --> 01:12:03,771
You must do something.

661
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:08,344
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

662
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:13,280
But your part in this tale is over.

663
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:15,683
Go back to your home.

664
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:27,996
Maybe Treebeard's right.

665
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:30,033
We don't belong here, Merry.

666
01:12:30,203 --> 01:12:32,467
It's too big for us.

667
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:35,301
What can we do in the end?

668
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,238
We've got the Shire.

669
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,305
Maybe we should go home.

670
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:48,382
The fires of Isengard will spread...

671
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:53,458
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

672
01:12:53,626 --> 01:12:55,218
And...

673
01:12:57,063 --> 01:13:00,089
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

674
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:06,538
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

675
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:27,287
Aragorn!

676
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,826
Fall back to the Keep!

677
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:33,089
Get your men out of there!

678
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,276
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

679
01:13:40,276 --> 01:13:42,276
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

680
01:13:42,775 --> 01:13:44,436
Haldir!

681
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:48,276
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

682
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:51,813
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

683
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:12,232
Haldir!

684
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,438
Brace the gate!

685
01:14:58,685 --> 01:14:59,982
Hold them!

686
01:15:01,754 --> 01:15:05,121
To the gate. Draw your swords!

687
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:35,220
Make way!

688
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:39,853
We cannot hold much longer!

689
01:15:45,865 --> 01:15:49,392
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

690
01:15:49,602 --> 01:15:52,162
As long as you can give me.

691
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:53,999
Gimli!

692
01:15:55,475 --> 01:15:56,840
Timbers!

693
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,978
Brace the gate!

694
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:15,388
Come on. We can take them.

695
01:16:16,262 --> 01:16:17,854
It's a long way.

696
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:24,899
Toss me.

697
01:16:26,072 --> 01:16:27,903
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

698
01:16:28,074 --> 01:16:29,632
You'll have to toss me!

699
01:16:35,248 --> 01:16:36,510
Don't tell the Elf.

700
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,813
Not a word.

701
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,533
Shore up the door!

702
01:16:55,702 --> 01:16:57,795
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

703
01:16:57,970 --> 01:16:59,028
Watch our backs!

704
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,339
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

705
01:17:55,328 --> 01:17:56,727
Hold fast the gate!

706
01:18:00,933 --> 01:18:03,868
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

707
01:18:08,608 --> 01:18:10,200
Aragorn!

708
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:46,110
Pull everybody back.

709
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:48,276
Pull them back.

710
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:50,282
Fall back!

711
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,941
Fall back!

712
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,815
They have broken through!

713
01:18:55,988 --> 01:18:58,252
The castle is breached. Retreat!

714
01:18:58,424 --> 01:19:00,654
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

715
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,354
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

716
01:19:03,563 --> 01:19:05,793
Into the Keep!

717
01:19:17,276 --> 01:19:22,236
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

718
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:27,114
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

719
01:19:32,859 --> 01:19:34,121
Wait! Stop!

720
01:19:35,027 --> 01:19:36,517
Stop!

721
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:41,360
Turn around.

722
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:44,997
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

723
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:50,165
But that will lead you past Isengard.

724
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,206
Yes. Exactly.

725
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:56,610
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

726
01:19:56,782 --> 01:19:59,444
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

727
01:19:59,619 --> 01:20:01,610
It's the last thing he'll expect.

728
01:20:04,223 --> 01:20:07,249
That doesn't make sense to me.

729
01:20:07,426 --> 01:20:08,586
But then...

730
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:11,456
you are very small.

731
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:13,693
Perhaps you're right.

732
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:17,859
South it is, then.

733
01:20:19,405 --> 01:20:22,738
Hold on, little Shirelings.

734
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:27,541
I always like going south.

735
01:20:27,713 --> 01:20:32,013
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

736
01:20:32,618 --> 01:20:35,086
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

737
01:20:35,254 --> 01:20:37,188
No, we won't.

738
01:20:37,924 --> 01:20:40,188
Not this time.

739
01:20:46,866 --> 01:20:47,855
Look!

740
01:20:49,535 --> 01:20:51,969
Osgiliath burns!

741
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,572
Mordor has come.

742
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:57,108
The Ring will not save Gondor.

743
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:00,640
It has only the power to destroy.

744
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,914
Please...

745
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:04,710
let me go.

746
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:07,344
Hurry.

747
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,223
Faramir!

748
01:21:12,392 --> 01:21:14,883
You must let me go!

749
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,787
And those little family of field mice...

750
01:21:18,966 --> 01:21:21,799
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

751
01:21:22,536 --> 01:21:25,835
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

752
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,952
Many of these trees were my friends.

753
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:45,284
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

754
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,654
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

755
01:21:47,828 --> 01:21:50,592
They had voices of their own.

756
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,391
Saruman.

757
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:58,829
A wizard should know better!

758
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:16,682
There is no curse in Elvish...

759
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,552
Entish or the tongues of Men...

760
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,058
for this treachery.

761
01:22:23,497 --> 01:22:26,330
Look! The trees! They're moving!

762
01:22:31,038 --> 01:22:32,232
Where are they going?

763
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:36,004
They have business with the Orcs.

764
01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:40,742
My business is with Isengard tonight...

765
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:43,542
with rock and stone.

766
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,567
Yes.

767
01:23:09,676 --> 01:23:11,109
Come, my friends.

768
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:16,644
The Ents are going to war.

769
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,580
It is likely...

770
01:23:18,752 --> 01:23:22,279
that we go to our doom.

771
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:26,158
Last march...

772
01:23:26,693 --> 01:23:28,718
of the Ents.

773
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:20,574
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

774
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:22,806
By nightfall we will be overrun.

775
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:27,052
Mr. Frodo?

776
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:31,450
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

777
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,116
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

778
01:24:48,475 --> 01:24:49,874
Take them to my father.

779
01:24:51,444 --> 01:24:54,436
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

780
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,876
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

781
01:25:00,987 --> 01:25:03,683
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

782
01:25:04,324 --> 01:25:07,088
You want to know why your brother died?

783
01:25:07,594 --> 01:25:11,325
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

784
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,431
He tried to kill him!

785
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,932
The Ring drove your brother mad!

786
01:25:16,703 --> 01:25:18,568
Watch out!

787
01:25:29,482 --> 01:25:30,608
Mr. Frodo?

788
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,084
They're here.

789
01:25:38,191 --> 01:25:40,659
They've come.

790
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,163
Nazgul!

791
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,381
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

792
01:26:11,191 --> 01:26:13,421
Take cover!

793
01:26:30,777 --> 01:26:32,335
The fortress is taken.

794
01:26:33,113 --> 01:26:34,307
It is over.

795
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:38,417
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

796
01:26:38,585 --> 01:26:41,520
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

797
01:26:44,257 --> 01:26:45,656
They're breaking in!

798
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,786
They're past the door!

799
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:58,297
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

800
01:27:00,907 --> 01:27:02,841
Is there no other way?

801
01:27:04,411 --> 01:27:07,471
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

802
01:27:08,148 --> 01:27:10,343
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

803
01:27:15,221 --> 01:27:17,621
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

804
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:20,658
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

805
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:26,263
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

806
01:27:30,937 --> 01:27:32,370
Ride out with me.

807
01:27:36,476 --> 01:27:38,103
Ride out and meet them.

808
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:41,039
For death and glory.

809
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,613
For Rohan.

810
01:27:44,117 --> 01:27:45,584
For your people.

811
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:48,253
The sun is rising.

812
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:55,751
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

813
01:27:55,929 --> 01:27:57,328
At dawn...

814
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:59,191
look to the east.

815
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:04,997
Yes.

816
01:28:07,474 --> 01:28:09,135
Yes.

817
01:28:10,477 --> 01:28:12,877
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

818
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:15,844
shall sound in the Deep...

819
01:28:16,282 --> 01:28:18,273
one last time.

820
01:28:18,451 --> 01:28:19,941
Yes!

821
01:28:22,989 --> 01:28:26,789
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

822
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:35,932
Fell deeds, awake.

823
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:38,195
Now for wrath...

824
01:28:38,405 --> 01:28:41,806
now for ruin and a red dawn.

825
01:28:48,748 --> 01:28:51,012
[Rohirric] <i>Forð Eorlingas!</i>
[English] Forth Eorlingas!

826
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:40,092
Gandalf.

827
01:29:47,407 --> 01:29:51,071
Theoden King stands alone.

828
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,840
Not alone.

829
01:29:54,248 --> 01:29:55,374
Rohirrim!

830
01:30:01,288 --> 01:30:02,448
Eomer.

831
01:30:02,623 --> 01:30:05,148
To the king!

832
01:31:22,803 --> 01:31:24,566
Yes!

833
01:31:33,714 --> 01:31:37,150
A hit. A fine hit.

834
01:32:01,675 --> 01:32:04,143
Break the dam!

835
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:07,747
Release the river!

836
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:37,839
Pippin! Hold on!

837
01:32:43,117 --> 01:32:46,052
Hold on, little Hobbits.

838
01:33:27,361 --> 01:33:29,386
What are you doing?

839
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:39,529
Where are you going?

840
01:34:37,731 --> 01:34:39,028
It's me.

841
01:34:41,568 --> 01:34:43,763
It's your Sam.

842
01:34:48,108 --> 01:34:50,736
Don't you know your Sam?

843
01:35:08,395 --> 01:35:11,762
I can't do this, Sam.

844
01:35:12,699 --> 01:35:14,667
I know.

845
01:35:15,702 --> 01:35:18,068
It's all wrong.

846
01:35:18,806 --> 01:35:20,831
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

847
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:30,341
But we are.

848
01:35:36,757 --> 01:35:39,783
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

849
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,360
The ones that really mattered.

850
01:35:43,397 --> 01:35:46,389
Full of darkness and danger they were.

851
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,569
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

852
01:35:49,736 --> 01:35:52,671
because how could the end be happy?

853
01:35:55,242 --> 01:35:57,437
How could the world go back to the way it was...

854
01:35:57,611 --> 01:36:01,047
when so much bad had happened?

855
01:36:01,882 --> 01:36:03,782
Victory!

856
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:05,509
We have victory!

857
01:36:05,686 --> 01:36:09,622
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

858
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:11,121
this shadow.

859
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:13,691
Even darkness must pass.

860
01:36:13,861 --> 01:36:16,557
A new day will come.

861
01:36:16,763 --> 01:36:20,699
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

862
01:36:22,636 --> 01:36:25,002
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

863
01:36:25,172 --> 01:36:26,935
that meant something.

864
01:36:27,107 --> 01:36:29,667
Even if you were too small to understand why.

865
01:36:31,044 --> 01:36:34,912
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

866
01:36:35,082 --> 01:36:36,640
I know now.

867
01:36:37,484 --> 01:36:39,679
Folk in those stories...

868
01:36:39,853 --> 01:36:43,983
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

869
01:36:44,157 --> 01:36:46,387
They kept going...

870
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:50,325
because they were holding on to something.

871
01:36:51,965 --> 01:36:54,263
What are we holding on to, Sam?

872
01:37:06,146 --> 01:37:10,082
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

873
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:12,978
And it's worth fighting for.

874
01:37:39,913 --> 01:37:44,213
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

875
01:37:44,952 --> 01:37:48,911
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

876
01:37:49,089 --> 01:37:51,284
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

877
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,061
Then it is forfeit.

878
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,528
Release them.

879
01:38:13,614 --> 01:38:15,673
Stay out of the forest!

880
01:38:15,849 --> 01:38:17,646
Keep away from the trees!

881
01:39:08,469 --> 01:39:10,266
Final count...

882
01:39:10,438 --> 01:39:13,339
- 42.
- 42?

883
01:39:14,809 --> 01:39:19,576
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

884
01:39:20,381 --> 01:39:24,044
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

885
01:39:28,156 --> 01:39:31,455
- 43.
- He was already dead.

886
01:39:32,226 --> 01:39:34,717
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

887
01:39:34,896 --> 01:39:39,595
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

888
01:39:41,836 --> 01:39:46,535
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

889
01:39:46,808 --> 01:39:50,335
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

890
01:39:50,511 --> 01:39:53,480
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

891
01:39:53,648 --> 01:39:56,481
I hear the staff are very good.

892
01:40:02,156 --> 01:40:04,522
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

893
01:40:04,692 --> 01:40:08,958
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

894
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,358
I'm starving.

895
01:40:10,565 --> 01:40:13,625
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

896
01:40:13,835 --> 01:40:16,861
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

897
01:40:40,862 --> 01:40:43,262
Saruman's storeroom!

898
01:40:45,633 --> 01:40:48,329
I don't believe it.

899
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:50,561
It can't be.

900
01:40:51,205 --> 01:40:54,106
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

901
01:40:55,409 --> 01:40:57,707
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

902
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:01,105
It's perfect. One barrel each.

903
01:41:01,282 --> 01:41:02,408
Wait.

904
01:41:03,151 --> 01:41:04,379
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

905
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:06,076
Share it?

906
01:41:07,922 --> 01:41:10,322
No. No.

907
01:41:11,826 --> 01:41:13,157
Dead plant and all that.

908
01:41:13,594 --> 01:41:15,755
Don't think he'd understand.

909
01:41:17,064 --> 01:41:19,225
Could be a distant relative.

910
01:41:20,034 --> 01:41:22,525
I get it.

911
01:41:22,737 --> 01:41:25,535
Don't be hasty.

912
01:41:26,641 --> 01:41:28,404
Exactly.

913
01:41:29,477 --> 01:41:31,741
Bar-hrum.

914
01:41:57,405 --> 01:41:58,702
This is the old sewer.

915
01:41:58,873 --> 01:42:01,933
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

916
01:42:02,109 --> 01:42:03,838
You'll find cover in the woods there.

917
01:42:04,912 --> 01:42:07,380
Captain Faramir...

918
01:42:08,015 --> 01:42:09,846
you have shown your quality, sir.

919
01:42:12,353 --> 01:42:13,650
The very highest.

920
01:42:14,155 --> 01:42:16,783
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

921
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:19,893
where gardeners are held in high honor.

922
01:42:21,095 --> 01:42:23,063
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

923
01:42:23,698 --> 01:42:25,222
Gollum says there's a path...

924
01:42:25,433 --> 01:42:29,369
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

925
01:42:29,837 --> 01:42:31,566
Cirith Ungol?

926
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:37,669
- Is that its name?
- No.

927
01:42:37,845 --> 01:42:39,506
No!

928
01:42:40,348 --> 01:42:43,340
- Yes.
- Frodo...

929
01:42:43,718 --> 01:42:47,245
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

930
01:42:48,155 --> 01:42:50,680
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

931
01:42:51,025 --> 01:42:57,294
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

932
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:00,596
I must.

933
01:43:04,138 --> 01:43:07,699
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

934
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,900
Thank you.

935
01:43:21,722 --> 01:43:25,852
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

936
01:43:38,339 --> 01:43:39,863
Come on, keep up.

937
01:43:43,344 --> 01:43:46,142
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

938
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:48,612
You know that, don't you?

939
01:43:49,417 --> 01:43:50,975
He was trying to save you, see?

940
01:43:51,485 --> 01:43:53,009
Save me?

941
01:43:53,354 --> 01:43:55,515
So there's no hard feelings.

942
01:43:55,690 --> 01:44:00,753
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

943
01:44:00,928 --> 01:44:03,556
Gollum, Gollum.

944
01:44:04,632 --> 01:44:06,361
Yes, master.

945
01:44:07,468 --> 01:44:10,301
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

946
01:44:10,471 --> 01:44:12,769
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

947
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:23,478
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

948
01:44:30,624 --> 01:44:33,616
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

949
01:44:34,295 --> 01:44:37,822
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

950
01:44:43,004 --> 01:44:46,440
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

951
01:44:47,408 --> 01:44:50,639
somewhere in the wilderness.

952
01:44:53,948 --> 01:44:57,349
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

953
01:44:57,518 --> 01:44:58,883
What?

954
01:44:59,053 --> 01:45:02,955
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

955
01:45:03,124 --> 01:45:06,389
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

956
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,495
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

957
01:45:09,663 --> 01:45:11,324
"Yes, my boy.

958
01:45:11,532 --> 01:45:15,332
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

959
01:45:15,503 --> 01:45:17,994
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

960
01:45:18,205 --> 01:45:20,105
"Samwise the Brave."

961
01:45:20,274 --> 01:45:23,004
I want to hear more about Sam.

962
01:45:27,314 --> 01:45:30,306
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

963
01:45:31,652 --> 01:45:35,679
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

964
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:38,156
So was I.

965
01:45:47,068 --> 01:45:49,730
"Samwise the Brave."

966
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,372
Smeagol?

967
01:45:55,543 --> 01:45:58,444
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

968
01:45:58,612 --> 01:46:00,546
Master.

969
01:46:00,714 --> 01:46:03,615
Master looks after us.

970
01:46:04,385 --> 01:46:07,183
Master wouldn't hurt us.

971
01:46:07,354 --> 01:46:09,822
Master broke his promise.

972
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,151
Don't ask Smeagol.

973
01:46:12,326 --> 01:46:15,523
Poor, poor Smeagol.

974
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:18,529
Master betrayed us.

975
01:46:18,732 --> 01:46:21,792
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

976
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:25,904
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

977
01:46:26,073 --> 01:46:28,803
Kill him! Kill him!

978
01:46:28,976 --> 01:46:30,466
Kill them both!

979
01:46:30,644 --> 01:46:34,273
And then we take the precious...

980
01:46:34,448 --> 01:46:37,975
and we be the master!

981
01:46:38,652 --> 01:46:41,314
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

982
01:46:41,489 --> 01:46:44,151
Eyes always watching.

983
01:46:44,325 --> 01:46:47,886
Then we stabs them out.

984
01:46:48,062 --> 01:46:52,556
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

985
01:46:52,766 --> 01:46:56,202
Yes. Yes. Yes.

986
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:59,099
Kill them both.

987
01:46:59,273 --> 01:47:01,673
Yes. No! No!

988
01:47:01,876 --> 01:47:05,573
It's too risky. It's too risky.

989
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,874
Where is he? Where has he gone?

990
01:47:09,049 --> 01:47:11,643
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

991
01:47:11,819 --> 01:47:17,223
We could let her do it.

992
01:47:18,192 --> 01:47:22,322
Yes. She could do it.

993
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:27,058
Yes, precious, she could.

994
01:47:27,268 --> 01:47:33,264
And then we takes it once they're dead.

995
01:47:34,241 --> 01:47:37,074
Once they're dead.

996
01:47:41,482 --> 01:47:45,179
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

997
01:47:45,352 --> 01:47:47,412
Smeagol will show you the way.

998
01:47:47,589 --> 01:47:49,819
Follow me.
