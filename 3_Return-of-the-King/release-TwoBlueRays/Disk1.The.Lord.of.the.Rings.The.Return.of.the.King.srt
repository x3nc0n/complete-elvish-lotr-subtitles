5
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,533
Smeagol!

6
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,541
I've got one!

7
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,097
I've got a fish, Smea... Smeagol!

8
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:27,313
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. 
Go on. Pull it in.

9
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,479
Deagol!

10
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:36,696
Deagol?

11
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,489
Deagol.

12
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,383
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

13
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,637
Why?

14
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,975
Because...

15
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,900
it's my birthday and I wants it.

16
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:52,198
My precious.

17
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,675
They cursed us.

18
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,220
Murderer.

19
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,844
"Murderer" they called us.

20
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:11,806
They cursed us and drove us away.

21
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,645
Gollum.

22
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,522
Gollum.

23
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,647
Gollum.

24
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,197
And we wept, precious.

25
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:28,948
We wept to be so alone.

26
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:35,322
- and cool
- So nice for feet

27
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:40,718
And we only wish To catch a fish

28
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:44,131
So juicy sweet

29
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,016
And we forgot the taste of bread...

30
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,660
the sound of trees...

31
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,893
the softness of the wind.

32
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:08,196
We even forgot our own name.

33
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:22,748
My precious.

34
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,246
Wake up!

35
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,960
Wake up!

36
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,860
Wake up, sleepies.

37
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,968
We must go, yes.

38
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,808
We must go at once.

39
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,437
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

40
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,188
I've gone and had too much.

41
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,313
Must be getting late.

42
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:34,983
No.

43
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:37,065
It isn't.

44
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,278
It isn't midday yet.

45
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:43,027
The days are growing darker.

46
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,501
Come on!

47
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,164
Must go! No time!

48
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,713
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

49
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,690
No time to lose, silly.

50
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,881
Here.

51
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,854
What about you?

52
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,398
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

53
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,366
Sam.

54
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,495
All right.

55
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,153
We don't have that much left.

56
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,202
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

57
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,296
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

58
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,875
I've rationed it.

59
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,043
There should be enough.

60
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,418
For what?

61
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,841
The journey home.

62
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,015
Come, Hobbitses.

63
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,276
Very close now.

64
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:02,696
Very close to Mordor.

65
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,534
No safe places here.

66
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,860
Hurry.

67
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:01,963
It's good.

68
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,625
Definitely from the Shire.

69
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,967
Longbottom Leaf.

70
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,640
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

71
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:22,981
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

72
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:27,730
Putting my feet up on a
settle after a hard day's work.

73
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,774
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

74
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,625
Welcome, my lords...

75
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,041
to Isengard!

76
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,109
You young rascals! A
merry hunt you've led us on...

77
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:59,128
...and now we find you
feasting and... and smoking!

78
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,687
We are sitting on a field of victory...

79
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:06,301
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

80
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:11,276
The salted pork is particularly good.

81
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:14,196
Salted pork?

82
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,825
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

83
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,831
who's taken over management of Isengard.

84
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,378
Young Master Gandalf.

85
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:32,126
I'm glad you've come.

86
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:36,713
Wood and water, stock
and stone I can master.

87
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:40,554
But there is a wizard to manage here...

88
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,719
locked in his tower.

89
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,585
Show yourself.

90
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,609
Be careful.

91
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,153
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

92
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,443
Well, let's just have his
head and be done with it.

93
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,586
No.

94
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:59,316
We need him alive.

95
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,774
We need him to talk.

96
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,475
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

97
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,573
and made peace afterwards.

98
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:15,603
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

99
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,978
Can we not have peace, you and I?

100
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,062
We shall have peace.

101
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:25,259
We shall have peace...

102
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:29,472
when you answer for the
burning of the Westfold...

103
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,460
...and the children that lie dead there!

104
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:37,277
We shall have peace when
the lives of the soldiers...

105
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,523
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

106
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:43,125
...against the gates of
the Hornburg, are avenged!

107
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:50,264
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

108
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,593
we shall have peace.

109
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,893
Gibbets and crows?

110
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,651
Dotard!

111
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:05,024
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

112
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,651
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

113
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:11,368
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

114
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,534
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

115
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,660
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

116
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,354
Thousands more are now at risk.

117
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,751
But you could save them, Saruman.

118
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:26,211
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

119
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,670
So you have come here for information.

120
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:32,382
I have some for you.

121
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,807
Something festers in
the heart of Middle-earth.

122
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,223
Something that you have failed to see.

123
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,235
But the Great Eye has seen it.

124
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,982
Even now he presses his advantage.

125
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,079
His attack will come soon.

126
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,416
You're all going to die.

127
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,911
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

128
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:13,968
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

129
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:20,683
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

130
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:25,227
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

131
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,356
those he professes to love.

132
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:33,945
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

133
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:37,264
before you sent him to his doom?

134
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:44,289
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

135
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,784
I've heard enough!

136
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,787
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

137
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,956
No.

138
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,631
Come down, Saruman...

139
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,906
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

140
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,410
I have no use for it!

141
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,940
Saruman...

142
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:14,152
your staff is broken.

143
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,492
Grima, you need not follow him.

144
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,338
You were not always as you are now.

145
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:35,340
You were once a Man of Rohan.

146
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,901
Come down.

147
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,631
A Man of Rohan?

148
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,796
What is the house of Rohan...

149
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:46,639
but a thatched barn where
brigands drink in the reek...

150
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,511
and their brats roll on
the floor with the dogs?

151
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:57,476
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

152
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:02,690
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

153
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,744
Grima...

154
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,454
come down.

155
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,202
Be free of him.

156
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,373
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

157
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,376
Get down, cur!

158
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,415
Saruman!

159
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,215
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

160
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,881
Tell us what you know!

161
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:33,634
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

162
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:37,348
I will not be held prisoner here.

163
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,207
Send word to all our allies...

164
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:09,336
...and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

165
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,761
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

166
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:35,903
The filth of Saruman...

167
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:39,913
is washing away.

168
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:44,628
Trees will come back to live here.

169
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,290
Young trees.

170
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,521
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

171
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,456
Bless my bark!

172
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,354
Peregrin Took!

173
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,147
I'll take that, my lad.

174
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,194
Quickly, now.

175
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:03,955
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

176
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,665
Hail the victorious dead.

177
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,246
Hail!

178
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,109
No pauses.

179
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:25,472
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

180
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,638
So it's a drinking game?

181
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,253
Last one standing wins.

182
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,293
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

183
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,492
To victory!

184
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,118
[Rohirric] <i>Westu Aragorn hál.</i>
[English] Be-thou Aragorn well!

185
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:25,445
I am happy for you.

186
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:28,236
He is an honorable man.

187
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:31,119
You are both honorable men.

188
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,298
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

189
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,299
Don't listen to me.

190
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,636
You are young.

191
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,136
And tonight is for you.

192
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:09,153
Here, here.

193
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:16,582
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

194
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,210
I feel something.

195
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,833
A slight tingle in my fingers.

196
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,131
I think it's affecting me.

197
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,766
What did I say?

198
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:37,269
He can't hold his liquor.

199
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:45,940
Game over.

200
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,529
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

201
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,650
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

202
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:58,205
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

203
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:02,289
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

204
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:05,628
But the only brew for the brave and true

205
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,540
Pippin!

206
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:13,047
But the only brew for the brave and true

207
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:16,094
Comes from The Green Dragon

208
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:21,646
Thank you! I win!

209
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:25,890
No news of Frodo?

210
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:29,568
No word. Nothing.

211
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:32,564
We have time.

212
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,361
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

213
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,197
Do we know that?

214
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:45,752
What does your heart tell you?

215
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:56,135
That Frodo is alive.

216
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,099
Yes.

217
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,845
Yes, he's alive.

218
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:09,942
Too risky. Too risky.

219
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,355
Thieves.

220
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,567
They stole it from us.

221
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:17,238
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

222
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:22,121
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

223
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,826
Mustn't ruin it now.

224
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,076
But they knows.

225
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,125
They knows.

226
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:31,916
They suspects us.

227
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:36,667
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

228
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:40,426
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

229
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,470
No. Not.

230
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:47,889
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

231
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:52,892
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

232
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,606
And we will.

233
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:59,824
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

234
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:05,831
It's ours!

235
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:08,667
Ours!

236
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,663
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

237
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:16,253
Patience! Patience, my love.

238
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:20,802
First we must lead them to her.

239
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,672
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

240
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,520
Yes, the stairs. And then?

241
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:32,687
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

242
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:39,273
until we come to the tunnel.

243
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:42,774
And when they go in...

244
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,737
there's no coming out.

245
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:49,533
She's always hungry.

246
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:54,500
She always needs to feed.

247
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,079
She must eat.

248
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,376
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

249
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:01,299
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

250
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,551
No.

251
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,428
Not very nice at all, my love.

252
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,386
She hungers for sweeter meats.

253
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,387
Hobbit meat.

254
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:18,390
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

255
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,652
then we will find it.

256
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:26,148
And take it for me!

257
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,320
For us.

258
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,829
Yes. We meant "for us."

259
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:36,450
Gollum. Gollum.

260
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:41,122
The precious will be ours...

261
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:45,793
once the Hobbitses are dead!

262
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,761
You treacherous little toad!

263
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,760
No! No! Master!

264
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:54,558
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

265
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:58,105
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

266
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:02,435
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

267
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,517
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

268
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:08,274
who hates Smeagol...

269
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:11,236
and who makes up nasty lies.

270
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,078
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

271
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:15,734
Sam!

272
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:18,411
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

273
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:23,288
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

274
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:26,629
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

275
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,294
You don't see it, do you?

276
00:26:28,718 --> 00:26:30,128
He's a villain.

277
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:34,755
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

278
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,469
I need you on my side.

279
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,594
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

280
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:46,061
I know, Sam. I know.

281
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,603
Trust me.

282
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,151
Come, Smeagol.

283
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,555
What time is it?

284
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,386
Not yet dawn.

285
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,352
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

286
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,526
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

287
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,237
I stood upon the brink.

288
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,327
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

289
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,036
A light shone behind me...

290
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,077
but I could not turn.

291
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,670
I could only stand there, waiting.

292
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,838
Night changes many thoughts.

293
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,379
Sleep, Eowyn.

294
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,173
Sleep...

295
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,768
while you can.

296
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,208
The stars are veiled.

297
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,713
Something stirs in the east.

298
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:26,504
A sleepless malice.

299
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:31,302
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

300
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:47,444
What are you doing?

301
00:29:52,078 --> 00:29:53,537
Pippin!

302
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,790
Pippin?

303
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,014
Pippin.

304
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:20,356
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

305
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:21,637
Just one more time.

306
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,975
Put it back.

307
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,036
Pippin.

308
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:44,039
No!

309
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:50,379
Pippin.

310
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:54,920
He is here.

311
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,386
I see you.

312
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,019
Pippin!

313
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,411
Help! Gandalf, help!

314
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:23,037
Someone help him!

315
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,621
Pippin!

316
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,003
Fool of a Took!

317
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,319
Look at me.

318
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,412
Gandalf, forgive me.

319
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,453
Look at me.

320
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,450
What did you see?

321
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,037
A tree.

322
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:14,880
There was a white tree...

323
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,545
in a courtyard of stone.

324
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:20,625
It was dead.

325
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,635
The city was burning.

326
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,180
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

327
00:32:30,857 --> 00:32:32,895
I saw...

328
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:37,654
I saw him.

329
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,900
I could hear his voice in my head.

330
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,484
And what did you tell him?

331
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,489
Speak!

332
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:54,834
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

333
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,464
He hurt me.

334
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,087
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

335
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,050
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

336
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,132
A fool...

337
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,598
but an honest fool he remains.

338
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:14,597
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

339
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,021
We've been strangely fortunate.

340
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:22,060
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

341
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,940
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

342
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:31,285
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

343
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:33,781
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

344
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,081
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

345
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:40,036
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

346
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:42,130
Sauron fears this.

347
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:46,630
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

348
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:50,213
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

349
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:53,890
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

350
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:57,975
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

351
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:01,106
Tell me...

352
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:05,060
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

353
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,777
What do we owe Gondor?

354
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:13,951
- I will go.
- No!

355
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:17,287
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

356
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:23,250
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

357
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:28,259
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

358
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,178
Understand this:

359
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:35,012
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

360
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,594
I ride for Minas Tirith...

361
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:43,526
and I won't be going alone.

362
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:48,941
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

363
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:51,608
Hurry! Hurry!

364
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,528
Where are we going?

365
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:55,948
Why did you look?

366
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:58,872
Why do you always have to look?

367
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,123
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

368
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:03,995
I'm sorry, all right?

369
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,006
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

370
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,716
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

371
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:15,634
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

372
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:19,727
And you...? You're coming with me?

373
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,347
Merry?

374
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,802
Come on.

375
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,696
How far is Minas Tirith?

376
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,484
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

377
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:38,157
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

378
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,364
Here.

379
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,330
Something for the road.

380
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,165
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

381
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:49,332
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

382
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:51,996
But... But we'll see each other soon.

383
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,835
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

384
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,888
I don't know what's going to happen.

385
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,767
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

386
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,394
Show us the meaning of haste.

387
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:07,472
Merry!

388
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,063
Merry!

389
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,037
He's always followed me...

390
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:33,751
everywhere I went...

391
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:35,880
since before we were tweens.

392
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:40,965
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

393
00:36:41,138 --> 00:36:43,214
but I was always there to get him out.

394
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,558
Now he's gone.

395
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:52,146
Just like Frodo and Sam.

396
00:36:52,774 --> 00:36:55,526
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

397
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,355
They're a most hardy folk.

398
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:01,604
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

399
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:18,376
Take her by the safest road.

400
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:21,040
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

401
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:25,085
It waits to carry her across the sea.

402
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:28,634
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

403
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,331
There is nothing for you here...

404
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,040
only death.

405
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,623
Lady Arwen...

406
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:51,461
we cannot delay.

407
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,176
My lady!

408
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:17,198
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

409
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,328
You have the gift of foresight.

410
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:21,290
What did you see?

411
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:25,251
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

412
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,918
But there is also life.

413
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:33,886
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

414
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:37,050
That future is almost gone.

415
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:39,216
But it is not lost.

416
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,017
Nothing is certain.

417
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,437
Some things are certain.

418
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,073
If I leave him now...

419
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:57,861
I will regret it forever.

420
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:01,277
It is time.

421
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:10,327
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

422
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:13,921
A light from the shadow shall spring

423
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:17,377
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

424
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,972
The crownless again shall be king

425
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,773
Re-forge the sword.

426
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,476
[Sindarin] <i>Ada.</i>
[English] Father.

427
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:11,349
Your hands are cold.

428
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,854
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

429
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:23,191
This was my choice.

430
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:24,779
[Sindarin] <i>Ada...</i>
[English] Father...

431
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:27,323
Whether by your will or not...

432
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:32,958
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

433
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,007
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

434
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:36,885
Minas Tirith.

435
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,805
City of kings.

436
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:12,970
Make way!

437
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,994
It's the tree.

438
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:45,828
Gandalf. Gandalf.

439
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,245
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

440
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:50,249
The tree of the king.

441
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:53,095
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

442
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:55,929
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

443
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,215
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

444
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:04,552
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

445
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:08,474
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

446
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,111
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

447
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:17,814
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

448
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:54,480
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

449
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:04,700
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

450
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,032
Perhaps you come to explain this.

451
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:19,215
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

452
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,691
Boromir died to save us...

453
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,521
my kinsman and me.

454
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:42,194
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

455
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:51,154
I offer you my service, such as it is...

456
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,700
in payment of this debt.

457
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,211
This is my first command to you.

458
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:03,375
How did you escape and my son did not...

459
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:06,044
so mighty a man as he was?

460
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,055
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

461
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,218
and Boromir was pierced by many.

462
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,064
Get up.

463
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,859
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

464
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,063
but it is not now.

465
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,988
War is coming.

466
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:32,738
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

467
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:37,077
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

468
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:42,126
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

469
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:46,794
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

470
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:51,922
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

471
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:55,135
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

472
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,433
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

473
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,693
I have seen more than you know.

474
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:08,064
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

475
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,109
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

476
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:14,984
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

477
00:47:15,162 --> 00:47:21,118
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

478
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:26,121
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

479
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:30,794
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

480
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:36,806
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

481
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:41,388
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

482
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:48,359
Come.

483
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:58,859
All has turned to vain ambition.

484
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:02,489
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

485
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:08,163
A thousand years this city has stood.

486
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,664
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

487
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:15,091
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

488
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:16,805
will never bloom again.

489
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:20,341
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

490
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:23,683
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

491
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:28,598
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

492
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:31,692
before it fell into decay.

493
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:35,112
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

494
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:39,574
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

495
00:48:39,785 --> 00:48:41,694
and counted the old names of their descent...

496
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,657
dearer than the names of their sons.

497
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:49,873
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

498
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:55,384
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

499
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,334
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

500
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,630
The line of kings failed.

501
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,722
The White Tree withered.

502
00:49:06,435 --> 00:49:10,599
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

503
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,570
Mordor.

504
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:26,742
Yes, there it lies.

505
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:30,915
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

506
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:34,579
A storm is coming.

507
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:38,172
This is not the weather of the world.

508
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,548
This is a device of Sauron's making.

509
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,467
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

510
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,511
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

511
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,511
so he covers the face of the sun...

512
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:53,433
to ease their passage along the road to war.

513
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:56,892
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

514
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,318
it will begin.

515
00:50:00,988 --> 00:50:02,566
Well...

516
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:04,277
Minas Tirith...

517
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:07,612
very impressive.

518
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:10,407
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

519
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,787
There's no leaving this city.

520
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:18,330
Help must come to us.

521
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,509
It must be getting near teatime.

522
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:26,376
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

523
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:30,137
We're not in decent places.

524
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:36,933
Mr. Frodo?

525
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:41,181
What is it?

526
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:46,026
It's just a feeling.

527
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:50,609
I don't think I'll be coming back.

528
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:57,661
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

529
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:00,166
That's just morbid thinking.

530
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:03,084
We're going there and back again...

531
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:05,545
just like Mr. Bilbo.

532
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,633
You'll see.

533
00:51:16,811 --> 00:51:20,428
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

534
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:28,863
Long ago, when there was a king.

535
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:52,343
Mr. Frodo, look.

536
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,722
The king has got a crown again.

537
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,106
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

538
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:33,009
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

539
00:52:33,176 --> 00:52:37,423
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

540
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:41,514
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

541
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:45,053
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

542
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:51,599
Ridiculous Hobbit.

543
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,984
Guard of the Citadel.

544
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:06,323
Thank you.

545
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:17,958
There's no more stars.

546
00:53:18,468 --> 00:53:19,667
Is it time?

547
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:22,589
Yes.

548
00:53:25,226 --> 00:53:26,886
It's so quiet.

549
00:53:27,895 --> 00:53:32,142
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

550
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:36,186
I don't want to be in a battle...

551
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:41,987
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

552
00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:49,155
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

553
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:53,619
There never was much hope.

554
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:57,331
Just a fool's hope.

555
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,007
Our enemy is ready.

556
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:08,851
His full strength's gathered.

557
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:12,516
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

558
00:54:12,688 --> 00:54:15,724
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

559
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:18,603
mercenaries from the coast.

560
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:21,350
All will answer Mordor's call.

561
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,071
Come on.

562
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:27,532
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

563
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:31,071
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

564
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,369
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

565
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:40,209
the last defense of this city will be gone.

566
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,426
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

567
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:51,885
Gandalf?

568
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:59,269
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

569
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:03,564
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

570
00:55:03,736 --> 00:55:08,897
The one they say no living man can kill.

571
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,068
The Witch King of Angmar.

572
00:55:13,162 --> 00:55:15,535
You've met him before.

573
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:18,780
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

574
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:28,046
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

575
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,967
the greatest of the Nine.

576
00:55:31,138 --> 00:55:34,756
Minas Morgul is his lair.

577
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:41,762
The Dead City.

578
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:47,147
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

579
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:56,527
Quick. Quick.

580
00:55:56,704 --> 00:56:00,702
They will see. They will see.

581
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:15,257
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

582
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:19,298
The way into Mordor.

583
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,806
The secret stair.

584
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,602
Climb.

585
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:49,628
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

586
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:57,339
- What's it doing?
- No.

587
00:56:57,513 --> 00:57:00,596
- They're calling me.
- No.

588
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:33,206
Hide! Hide!

589
00:58:16,755 --> 00:58:19,591
I can feel his blade.

590
00:58:31,268 --> 00:58:33,392
We come to it at last.

591
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:38,102
The great battle of our time.

592
00:59:17,272 --> 00:59:20,521
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

593
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:33,410
The board is set.

594
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:36,117
The pieces are moving.

595
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:41,337
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

596
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:44,171
And then it's into the tunnel.

597
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:47,543
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

598
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:50,844
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

599
00:59:51,012 --> 00:59:53,930
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

600
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:55,676
One sniff something's not right...

601
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:59,016
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

602
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:01,897
No more slinker. No more stinker.

603
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,853
You're gone. Got it?

604
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,727
I'm watching you.

605
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:15,067
What was that about?

606
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:17,650
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

607
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:27,165
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

608
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:31,916
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

609
01:00:36,764 --> 01:00:38,343
You must not fail me.

610
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:15,674
It's been very quiet across the river.

611
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:18,168
The Orcs are lying low.

612
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:20,338
The garrison may have moved out.

613
01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:24,178
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

614
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:27,636
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

615
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:54,161
Quiet.

616
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:00,216
We need 10 more.

617
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,074
Kill him!

618
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,790
They're not coming from the north.

619
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,549
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

620
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,596
Faster.

621
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:09,114
Draw swords.

622
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:06,244
Hold! Hold them!

623
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:28,416
What?

624
01:05:40,972 --> 01:05:42,383
Amon Din

625
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:51,225
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

626
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:58,697
Hope is kindled.

627
01:07:31,078 --> 01:07:35,457
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

628
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,291
Gondor calls for aid.

629
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:51,721
And Rohan will answer.

630
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,927
Muster the Rohirrim.

631
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,990
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

632
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,537
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

633
01:08:16,705 --> 01:08:21,996
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

634
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,289
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

635
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:25,790
- Gamling.
- My lord.

636
01:08:25,963 --> 01:08:27,542
Make haste across the Riddermark.

637
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:29,839
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

638
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,588
I will.

639
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:38,848
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

640
01:08:39,017 --> 01:08:42,932
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

641
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:51,397
The men have found their captain.

642
01:08:51,573 --> 01:08:54,905
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

643
01:08:55,075 --> 01:08:56,653
You have given us hope.

644
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:01,829
Excuse me.

645
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:04,661
I have a sword.

646
01:09:04,961 --> 01:09:06,336
Please accept it.

647
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:11,958
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

648
01:09:15,386 --> 01:09:17,462
And gladly I accept it.

649
01:09:18,556 --> 01:09:22,636
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

650
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:28,721
Horse-Men.

651
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:35,023
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

652
01:09:35,406 --> 01:09:38,360
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

653
01:09:38,534 --> 01:09:41,950
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

654
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,881
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

655
01:10:04,059 --> 01:10:07,925
the doom of our time will be decided.

656
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:16,063
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

657
01:10:16,237 --> 01:10:19,771
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

658
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,823
Faramir!

659
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:14,823
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

660
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:18,502
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

661
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:29,505
Nazgul.

662
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:34,348
Take cover!

663
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,057
Nazgul!

664
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,896
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

665
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:49,365
Fall back!

666
01:11:56,416 --> 01:12:00,995
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

667
01:12:25,235 --> 01:12:29,564
The age of Men is over.

668
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:35,362
The time of the Orc has come.

669
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:40,072
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

670
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:44,081
Take cover, my lord!

671
01:12:44,378 --> 01:12:45,707
It's coming!

672
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:54,629
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

673
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:35,968
Pull!

674
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,102
Mithrandir.

675
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,025
They broke through our defenses.

676
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,406
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

677
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:05,657
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

678
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:10,374
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

679
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:16,165
Faramir?

680
01:14:18,094 --> 01:14:21,925
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

681
01:14:22,097 --> 01:14:24,303
No.

682
01:14:25,642 --> 01:14:27,184
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

683
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:31,477
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

684
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:33,724
Not two days ago.

685
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:38,652
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

686
01:14:39,364 --> 01:14:41,985
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

687
01:14:44,202 --> 01:14:46,574
What does that mean?

688
01:14:46,746 --> 01:14:51,656
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

689
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:53,873
Tell me all you know.

690
01:14:55,046 --> 01:14:58,461
This is how you would serve your city?

691
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:01,918
You would risk its utter ruin?

692
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:04,546
I did what I judged to be right.

693
01:15:05,262 --> 01:15:08,264
What you judged to be right.

694
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:14,765
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

695
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:23,562
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

696
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,742
Hidden.

697
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,912
Dark and deep in the vaults...

698
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:32,238
not to be used.

699
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:41,294
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

700
01:15:41,758 --> 01:15:43,797
I would not use the Ring.

701
01:15:43,968 --> 01:15:47,053
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

702
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:52,214
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

703
01:15:52,392 --> 01:15:54,634
as a king of old.

704
01:15:56,437 --> 01:16:00,187
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

705
01:16:00,609 --> 01:16:03,064
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

706
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:05,815
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

707
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,358
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

708
01:16:09,533 --> 01:16:11,775
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

709
01:16:13,663 --> 01:16:15,821
And when he returned...

710
01:16:16,957 --> 01:16:18,617
you would not have known your son.

711
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:21,330
Boromir was loyal to me!

712
01:16:21,503 --> 01:16:24,076
Not some wizard's pupil!

713
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:33,549
Father?

714
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:48,144
My son.

715
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:15,763
Leave me.

716
01:17:49,337 --> 01:17:51,875
Careful, master. Careful.

717
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:55,133
Very far to fall.

718
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:01,551
Very dangerous are the stairs.

719
01:18:04,227 --> 01:18:06,765
Come, master.

720
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:15,734
Come to Smeagol.

721
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:23,571
Mr. Frodo.

722
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,122
Get back, you!

723
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,496
Don't touch him!

724
01:18:32,628 --> 01:18:35,464
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

725
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:39,333
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

726
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:41,883
Master?

727
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,131
Master carries heavy burden.

728
01:18:46,308 --> 01:18:51,729
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

729
01:18:51,897 --> 01:18:55,148
Fat one cannot know.

730
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,945
Smeagol look after master.

731
01:19:01,156 --> 01:19:03,363
He wants it.

732
01:19:03,533 --> 01:19:08,076
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

733
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:13,703
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

734
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:17,744
The fat one will take it from you.

735
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:29,301
Send forth all legions.

736
01:19:29,475 --> 01:19:33,520
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

737
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:37,350
Slay them all.

738
01:19:39,026 --> 01:19:44,814
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

739
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,567
Where are Theoden's riders?

740
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:53,319
Will Rohan's army come?

741
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,740
Mithrandir.

742
01:19:56,793 --> 01:20:00,659
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

743
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:08,173
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

744
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:15,969
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

745
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,639
It was well-done.

746
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:24,861
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

747
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,151
You are to join the tower guard.

748
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:31,698
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

749
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,323
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

750
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:36,037
A very foolish one...

751
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:40,453
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

752
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,379
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

753
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,337
My father had it made for me.

754
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:47,711
Well...

755
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,875
I'm taller than you were then.

756
01:20:50,052 --> 01:20:53,386
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

757
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,390
Never fitted me either.

758
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,396
Boromir was always the soldier.

759
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,807
They were so alike, he and my father.

760
01:21:08,904 --> 01:21:10,529
Proud.

761
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:11,896
Stubborn even.

762
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:15,153
But strong.

763
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:19,828
I think you have strength of a different kind.

764
01:21:20,457 --> 01:21:22,912
And one day your father will see it.

765
01:21:27,088 --> 01:21:30,872
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

766
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,545
in peace or war...

767
01:21:33,178 --> 01:21:35,633
in living or dying...

768
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,259
from...

769
01:21:40,935 --> 01:21:43,721
From this hour henceforth...

770
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,804
until my lord release me...

771
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,522
or death take me.

772
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,601
And I shall not forget it...

773
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:56,149
nor fail to reward that which is given.

774
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:06,037
Fealty with love.

775
01:22:07,126 --> 01:22:08,787
Valor with honor.

776
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:13,712
Disloyalty with vengeance.

777
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:26,430
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

778
01:22:26,604 --> 01:22:29,355
defenses that your brother long held intact.

779
01:22:29,522 --> 01:22:32,013
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

780
01:22:32,192 --> 01:22:34,979
the river in Pelennor unfought.

781
01:22:35,153 --> 01:22:36,813
Osgiliath must be retaken.

782
01:22:36,988 --> 01:22:39,029
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

783
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,486
Much must be risked in war.

784
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:49,071
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

785
01:22:55,297 --> 01:22:58,547
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

786
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:02,345
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

787
01:23:05,766 --> 01:23:07,509
Yes.

788
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:10,391
I wish that.

789
01:23:18,778 --> 01:23:21,269
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

790
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:26,034
I will do what I can in his stead.

791
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:38,670
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

792
01:23:40,758 --> 01:23:44,375
That will depend on the manner of your return.

793
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:10,000
What are you up to?

794
01:25:10,177 --> 01:25:11,421
Sneaking off, are we?

795
01:25:12,137 --> 01:25:13,963
Sneaking?

796
01:25:14,973 --> 01:25:17,131
Sneaking?

797
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,726
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

798
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:26,972
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

799
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:29,309
and they say "sneak."

800
01:25:29,945 --> 01:25:32,520
Sneak?

801
01:25:33,157 --> 01:25:35,862
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

802
01:25:36,035 --> 01:25:38,657
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

803
01:25:39,914 --> 01:25:42,119
You just startled me is all.

804
01:25:42,624 --> 01:25:44,451
What were you doing?

805
01:25:46,086 --> 01:25:48,208
Sneaking.

806
01:25:48,588 --> 01:25:51,674
Fine. Have it your own way.

807
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:56,418
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

808
01:25:56,805 --> 01:25:58,761
We have to be moving on.

809
01:26:03,936 --> 01:26:05,514
It's dark still.

810
01:26:05,688 --> 01:26:07,895
It's always dark here.

811
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:14,061
It's gone!

812
01:26:15,281 --> 01:26:18,151
- The Elven bread.
- What?

813
01:26:18,325 --> 01:26:19,784
That's all we have left.

814
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:26,364
He took it. He must have!

815
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:30,126
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

816
01:26:30,295 --> 01:26:33,213
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

817
01:26:33,382 --> 01:26:36,548
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

818
01:26:36,718 --> 01:26:38,260
He doesn't eat it.

819
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:41,587
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

820
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,468
What's this?

821
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:50,479
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

822
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:52,851
He took it.

823
01:26:53,693 --> 01:26:57,903
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

824
01:26:58,072 --> 01:26:59,864
That's a filthy lie!

825
01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:02,239
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

826
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:03,655
- Sam!
- Call me...

827
01:27:03,828 --> 01:27:05,073
Stop it!

828
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,278
Sam!

829
01:27:08,582 --> 01:27:12,199
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

830
01:27:13,253 --> 01:27:18,793
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

831
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,090
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

832
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:23,337
- I'm all right.
- No.

833
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:26,597
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

834
01:27:26,765 --> 01:27:28,888
It's that Gollum.

835
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:30,768
It's this place.

836
01:27:30,936 --> 01:27:33,509
It's that thing around your neck.

837
01:27:37,027 --> 01:27:38,307
I could help a bit.

838
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,154
I could carry it for a while.

839
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:43,065
Carry it for a while.

840
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,485
I could carry it... I could carry it.

841
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:50,573
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

842
01:27:50,747 --> 01:27:51,947
Get away!

843
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,701
I don't want to keep it.

844
01:27:57,296 --> 01:27:59,287
I just want to help.

845
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,963
See? See?

846
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:07,551
He wants it for himself.

847
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:09,430
Shut up, you!

848
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:11,801
Go away! Get out of here!

849
01:28:11,976 --> 01:28:13,803
No, Sam.

850
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:15,223
It's you.

851
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,149
I'm sorry, Sam.

852
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,194
But he's a liar.

853
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:27,032
He's poisoned you against me.

854
01:28:28,451 --> 01:28:30,359
You can't help me anymore.

855
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:34,202
You don't mean that.

856
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,499
Go home.

857
01:29:58,537 --> 01:30:00,328
Faramir!

858
01:30:00,497 --> 01:30:02,406
Faramir!

859
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:05,957
Your father's will has turned to madness.

860
01:30:07,127 --> 01:30:09,167
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

861
01:30:09,922 --> 01:30:12,248
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

862
01:30:12,884 --> 01:30:15,802
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

863
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:19,216
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

864
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,593
her memory, her wisdom.

865
01:30:24,978 --> 01:30:28,395
Your father loves you, Faramir.

866
01:30:29,108 --> 01:30:32,109
He will remember it before the end.

867
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:43,261
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

868
01:31:46,244 --> 01:31:47,738
Well...

869
01:31:48,288 --> 01:31:49,912
yes.

870
01:31:50,624 --> 01:31:54,371
At least, well enough for my own people.

871
01:31:56,004 --> 01:31:58,411
But we have no songs for great halls...

872
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:00,710
and evil times.

873
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:04,717
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

874
01:32:07,514 --> 01:32:08,925
Come, sing me a song.

875
01:32:19,986 --> 01:32:23,318
Home is behind

876
01:32:23,487 --> 01:32:27,236
The world ahead

877
01:32:29,661 --> 01:32:35,496
And there are many paths to tread

878
01:32:37,292 --> 01:32:40,827
Through shadow

879
01:32:41,004 --> 01:32:45,168
To the edge of night

880
01:32:46,844 --> 01:32:51,921
Until the stars are all alight

881
01:32:54,935 --> 01:32:59,263
Mist and shadow

882
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,732
Cloud and shade

883
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:09,446
All shall fade

884
01:33:11,826 --> 01:33:15,823
All shall

885
01:33:21,586 --> 01:33:23,958
Fade

886
01:33:48,361 --> 01:33:51,812
March! March!

887
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:57,197
March! March! March!

888
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,991
Make way for the king.

889
01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:06,493
Make way.

890
01:34:08,963 --> 01:34:11,003
The king is here.

891
01:34:12,968 --> 01:34:14,593
My lord.

892
01:34:15,847 --> 01:34:17,803
Hail to you, sire.

893
01:34:18,266 --> 01:34:19,462
Grimbold, how many?

894
01:34:19,641 --> 01:34:22,096
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

895
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:25,730
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

896
01:34:26,856 --> 01:34:30,806
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

897
01:34:47,877 --> 01:34:50,000
Six thousand spears.

898
01:34:51,046 --> 01:34:53,039
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

899
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:56,709
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

900
01:34:59,471 --> 01:35:01,214
More will come.

901
01:35:01,598 --> 01:35:04,551
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

902
01:35:04,725 --> 01:35:07,299
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

903
01:35:26,789 --> 01:35:29,114
The horses are restless...

904
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:30,786
and the men are quiet.

905
01:35:31,252 --> 01:35:34,370
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

906
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,713
That road there...

907
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,711
where does that lead?

908
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:46,303
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

909
01:35:47,017 --> 01:35:50,017
None who venture there ever return.

910
01:35:51,228 --> 01:35:53,102
That mountain is evil.

911
01:36:16,045 --> 01:36:17,871
Aragorn.

912
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,539
Let's find some food.

913
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:38,434
There.

914
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,401
A true esquire of Rohan.

915
01:36:46,032 --> 01:36:48,023
I'm ready.

916
01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:50,898
Sorry.

917
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:53,319
It isn't all that dangerous.

918
01:36:53,831 --> 01:36:56,156
It's not even sharp.

919
01:36:56,834 --> 01:37:00,250
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

920
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:01,915
Come on.

921
01:37:06,091 --> 01:37:08,584
To the smithy. Go!

922
01:37:10,055 --> 01:37:12,593
You should not encourage him.

923
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:15,221
You should not doubt him.

924
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:18,678
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

925
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:22,976
Why should Merry be left behind?

926
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:25,772
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

927
01:37:27,947 --> 01:37:31,113
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

928
01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:37,370
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

929
01:37:38,623 --> 01:37:40,699
When the fear takes him...

930
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:45,918
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

931
01:37:46,298 --> 01:37:48,455
do you think he would stand and fight?

932
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:52,635
He would flee.

933
01:37:52,804 --> 01:37:54,843
And he would be right to do so.

934
01:37:57,058 --> 01:38:01,009
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

935
01:38:36,679 --> 01:38:40,380
I choose a mortal life.

936
01:38:43,311 --> 01:38:46,180
I wish I could've seen him...

937
01:38:47,314 --> 01:38:50,019
one last time.

938
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:02,613
Sir?

939
01:39:04,456 --> 01:39:07,029
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

940
01:39:27,812 --> 01:39:29,769
I take my leave.

941
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:45,656
My lord Elrond.

942
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:49,745
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

943
01:39:52,835 --> 01:39:54,828
Arwen is dying.

944
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:03,678
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

945
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:07,799
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

946
01:40:07,975 --> 01:40:11,973
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

947
01:40:12,146 --> 01:40:15,893
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

948
01:40:16,649 --> 01:40:19,223
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

949
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:21,271
The end has come.

950
01:40:21,656 --> 01:40:24,276
It will not be our end, but his.

951
01:40:25,033 --> 01:40:28,616
You ride to war, but not to victory.

952
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:33,285
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

953
01:40:33,457 --> 01:40:37,871
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

954
01:40:38,338 --> 01:40:41,754
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

955
01:40:42,384 --> 01:40:44,459
They'll be in the city in two days.

956
01:40:44,968 --> 01:40:47,803
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

957
01:40:48,513 --> 01:40:50,637
You need more men.

958
01:40:51,016 --> 01:40:52,760
There are none.

959
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,434
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

960
01:41:07,448 --> 01:41:09,607
Murderers...

961
01:41:09,784 --> 01:41:11,196
traitors.

962
01:41:13,664 --> 01:41:15,821
You would call upon them to fight?

963
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:17,576
They believe in nothing.

964
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,873
They answer to no one.

965
01:41:20,044 --> 01:41:23,128
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

966
01:41:30,262 --> 01:41:35,387
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

967
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:54,111
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

968
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:12,919
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

969
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:15,502
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

970
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:19,547
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

971
01:42:21,395 --> 01:42:23,553
Put aside the Ranger.

972
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:27,064
Become who you were born to be.

973
01:42:27,234 --> 01:42:29,226
Take the Dimholt road.

974
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:35,547
[Sindarin] <i>Ónen i-Estel Edain.</i>
[English] I gave hope to Men.

975
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:40,394
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-chebin...</i>
[English] I have kept...

976
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,195
[Sindarin] <i>...Estel anim.</i>
[English] ...no hope for me.

977
01:42:55,261 --> 01:42:56,922
Why are you doing this?

978
01:42:57,388 --> 01:43:00,590
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

979
01:43:03,018 --> 01:43:05,093
You cannot abandon the men.

980
01:43:06,396 --> 01:43:07,973
Eowyn...

981
01:43:08,147 --> 01:43:10,354
We need you here.

982
01:43:11,484 --> 01:43:13,358
Why have you come?

983
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:16,986
Do you not know?

984
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:29,291
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

985
01:43:33,213 --> 01:43:35,622
I cannot give you what you seek.

986
01:43:49,146 --> 01:43:53,060
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

987
01:44:12,209 --> 01:44:14,497
Just where do you think you're off to?

988
01:44:14,669 --> 01:44:15,998
Not this time.

989
01:44:16,171 --> 01:44:18,377
This time you must stay, Gimli.

990
01:44:21,093 --> 01:44:23,928
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

991
01:44:24,097 --> 01:44:27,760
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

992
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:52,237
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

993
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:54,455
Where's he going?

994
01:44:57,044 --> 01:44:59,083
I don't understand.

995
01:45:03,509 --> 01:45:05,300
Lord Aragorn!

996
01:45:05,719 --> 01:45:08,423
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

997
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:11,715
He leaves because there is no hope.

998
01:45:12,391 --> 01:45:14,515
He leaves because he must.

999
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:16,394
Too few have come.

1000
01:45:16,563 --> 01:45:18,721
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

1001
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:22,894
No...

1002
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:24,564
we cannot.

1003
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:31,232
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

1004
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,417
I have left instruction.

1005
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:53,345
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

1006
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,179
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1007
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:06,277
Long may you defend Edoras...

1008
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:08,770
if the battle goes ill.

1009
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:13,279
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1010
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,451
Duty?

1011
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:20,951
No.

1012
01:46:29,257 --> 01:46:31,380
I would have you smile again...

1013
01:46:34,804 --> 01:46:39,799
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1014
01:46:44,647 --> 01:46:48,146
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1015
01:46:52,488 --> 01:46:55,238
and no more despair.

1016
01:47:01,455 --> 01:47:05,155
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1017
01:47:05,334 --> 01:47:07,161
One that is cursed.

1018
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,666
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1019
01:47:12,089 --> 01:47:14,841
to the last king of Gondor...

1020
01:47:15,427 --> 01:47:17,004
to come to his aid...

1021
01:47:17,178 --> 01:47:18,886
to fight.

1022
01:47:19,389 --> 01:47:21,547
But when the time came...

1023
01:47:22,184 --> 01:47:24,803
when Gondor's need was dire...

1024
01:47:24,976 --> 01:47:26,850
they fled...

1025
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,390
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1026
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:33,767
And so Isildur cursed them...

1027
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:39,188
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1028
01:47:43,495 --> 01:47:46,661
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1029
01:47:47,123 --> 01:47:49,365
The forgotten people.

1030
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:52,034
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1031
01:47:52,505 --> 01:47:54,377
From the north shall he come.

1032
01:47:54,881 --> 01:47:56,540
Need shall drive him.

1033
01:47:57,634 --> 01:48:01,132
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1034
01:48:19,613 --> 01:48:22,899
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1035
01:48:28,455 --> 01:48:30,412
The way is shut.

1036
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:33,123
It was made by those who are dead.

1037
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:35,993
And the Dead keep it.

1038
01:48:36,546 --> 01:48:38,088
The way is shut.

1039
01:48:49,434 --> 01:48:50,928
Brego!

1040
01:48:54,438 --> 01:48:57,142
I do not fear death.

1041
01:49:09,452 --> 01:49:11,860
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1042
01:49:12,038 --> 01:49:16,700
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1043
01:49:16,877 --> 01:49:18,205
Oh.

1044
01:49:18,378 --> 01:49:21,213
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1045
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:38,470
We must ride light and swift.

1046
01:49:38,647 --> 01:49:40,390
It is a long road ahead.

1047
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:43,650
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1048
01:49:49,157 --> 01:49:52,159
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1049
01:49:52,494 --> 01:49:54,486
All my friends have gone to battle.

1050
01:49:54,662 --> 01:49:56,536
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1051
01:49:56,706 --> 01:49:58,829
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1052
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,372
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1053
01:50:02,378 --> 01:50:04,501
I want to fight.

1054
01:50:05,006 --> 01:50:06,998
I will say no more.

1055
01:50:23,815 --> 01:50:25,772
Ride with me.

1056
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:28,646
My lady.

1057
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:31,192
Form up! Move out!

1058
01:50:31,365 --> 01:50:34,568
Form up! Move out!

1059
01:50:37,661 --> 01:50:38,859
Ride!

1060
01:50:39,038 --> 01:50:41,992
Ride now to Gondor!

1061
01:50:51,219 --> 01:50:52,819
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1062
01:50:54,343 --> 01:50:55,643
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1063
01:50:55,644 --> 01:50:56,244
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1064
01:50:56,245 --> 01:50:57,545
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1065
01:50:57,546 --> 01:50:58,046
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1066
01:50:58,047 --> 01:50:59,347
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1067
01:50:59,348 --> 01:51:00,848
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh chadar! </i>
[English]  Loud enough!

1068
01:51:23,623 --> 01:51:25,366
What is it?

1069
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,083
What do you see?

1070
01:51:27,334 --> 01:51:29,457
I see shapes of men.

1071
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:33,506
And of horses.

1072
01:51:34,258 --> 01:51:35,456
Where?

1073
01:51:35,634 --> 01:51:38,588
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1074
01:51:41,015 --> 01:51:43,220
Spears rise...

1075
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:47,302
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1076
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:50,721
The Dead are following.

1077
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:53,436
They have been summoned.

1078
01:51:54,111 --> 01:51:55,937
The Dead?

1079
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:58,029
Summoned?

1080
01:51:58,448 --> 01:52:00,322
I knew that.

1081
01:52:03,661 --> 01:52:05,405
Very good.

1082
01:52:06,122 --> 01:52:08,197
Very good! Legolas!

1083
01:52:46,161 --> 01:52:47,571
Do not look down.

1084
01:53:40,171 --> 01:53:45,296
Who enters my domain?

1085
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:51,259
One who will have your allegiance.

1086
01:53:54,224 --> 01:53:59,564
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1087
01:53:59,898 --> 01:54:02,567
You will suffer me.

1088
01:54:26,088 --> 01:54:29,459
The way is shut.

1089
01:54:30,636 --> 01:54:35,095
It was made by those who are dead.

1090
01:54:35,473 --> 01:54:39,636
And the Dead keep it.

1091
01:54:48,778 --> 01:54:51,862
The way is shut.

1092
01:54:53,616 --> 01:54:56,237
Now you must die.

1093
01:55:00,122 --> 01:55:02,957
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1094
01:55:03,292 --> 01:55:08,249
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1095
01:55:13,844 --> 01:55:16,001
That line was broken.

1096
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,845
It has been remade.

1097
01:55:28,774 --> 01:55:30,317
Fight for us...

1098
01:55:30,485 --> 01:55:33,023
and regain your honor.

1099
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:38,527
What say you?

1100
01:55:50,753 --> 01:55:52,295
What say you?

1101
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:54,839
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1102
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,175
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1103
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:01,170
I am Isildur's heir.

1104
01:56:01,724 --> 01:56:03,679
Fight for me...

1105
01:56:04,266 --> 01:56:07,849
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1106
01:56:11,774 --> 01:56:13,732
What say you?

1107
01:56:21,658 --> 01:56:23,865
You have my word!

1108
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:28,159
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1109
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:31,120
What say you?!

1110
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:37,375
Stand, you traitors!

1111
01:57:04,323 --> 01:57:05,355
Out!

1112
01:57:26,721 --> 01:57:28,299
Legolas!

1113
01:57:29,433 --> 01:57:30,630
Run!

1114
01:58:36,955 --> 01:58:39,030
We fight.

1115
01:58:49,383 --> 01:58:51,957
Open the gate! Quick!

1116
01:59:22,999 --> 01:59:24,992
Quick! Hurry!

1117
01:59:38,763 --> 01:59:40,388
Faramir!

1118
01:59:41,392 --> 01:59:44,642
Say not that he has fallen.

1119
01:59:45,813 --> 01:59:47,355
They were outnumbered.

1120
01:59:47,772 --> 01:59:49,350
None survived.

1121
01:59:50,066 --> 01:59:52,059
Fear.

1122
01:59:52,611 --> 01:59:55,814
The city is rank with it.

1123
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:00,613
Let us ease their pain.

1124
02:00:00,869 --> 02:00:02,612
Release the prisoners.

1125
02:00:02,787 --> 02:00:04,745
Catapults!

1126
02:00:18,093 --> 02:00:21,545
My sons are spent.

1127
02:00:22,598 --> 02:00:25,515
My line has ended.

1128
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:29,765
He's alive!

1129
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:33,104
The House of Stewards has failed.

1130
02:00:33,274 --> 02:00:34,733
He needs medicine, my lord.

1131
02:00:35,778 --> 02:00:38,446
My line has ended!

1132
02:00:39,948 --> 02:00:41,941
My lord!

1133
02:00:55,464 --> 02:00:57,290
Rohan...

1134
02:00:58,049 --> 02:01:00,455
has deserted us.

1135
02:01:14,897 --> 02:01:18,100
Theoden's betrayed me.

1136
02:01:29,246 --> 02:01:31,072
Abandon your posts!

1137
02:01:32,123 --> 02:01:36,037
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1138
02:01:46,178 --> 02:01:47,720
Prepare for battle!

1139
02:01:48,263 --> 02:01:51,429
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1140
02:01:52,601 --> 02:01:54,558
Over here!

1141
02:01:55,312 --> 02:01:57,684
Return to your posts!

1142
02:02:08,491 --> 02:02:11,112
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1143
02:02:21,295 --> 02:02:22,754
Stay where you are.

1144
02:02:39,729 --> 02:02:41,140
We need more rubble!

1145
02:02:41,314 --> 02:02:43,188
Watch out!

1146
02:02:43,358 --> 02:02:45,895
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1147
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:49,320
Double up, men!

1148
02:03:58,304 --> 02:04:01,305
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1149
02:04:01,808 --> 02:04:05,307
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1150
02:04:45,975 --> 02:04:47,599
Not at the towers!

1151
02:04:47,768 --> 02:04:50,769
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1152
02:04:51,522 --> 02:04:53,349
Bring them down!

1153
02:05:28,473 --> 02:05:30,514
Fight them back!

1154
02:05:30,685 --> 02:05:32,678
Peregrin Took!

1155
02:05:33,563 --> 02:05:36,729
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1156
02:05:52,415 --> 02:05:54,787
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1157
02:06:20,524 --> 02:06:21,984
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1158
02:06:22,611 --> 02:06:25,943
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1159
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:40,245
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1160
02:06:40,419 --> 02:06:42,376
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1161
02:06:48,718 --> 02:06:51,125
Get back there and smash it down.

1162
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:53,296
But nothing can breach it.

1163
02:06:56,224 --> 02:06:58,467
Grond will breach it.

1164
02:07:01,897 --> 02:07:03,973
Bring up the wolf's head.

1165
02:07:07,152 --> 02:07:12,490
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1166
02:07:12,824 --> 02:07:16,657
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1167
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:21,996
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1168
02:07:22,709 --> 02:07:26,373
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1169
02:07:26,795 --> 02:07:30,959
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1170
02:07:31,134 --> 02:07:34,835
Grond! Grond! Grond!!
