5
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,533
Smeagol!

6
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,541
I've got one!

7
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,097
I've got a fish, Smea... Smeagol!

8
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:27,313
Pull it in. Go on. Go on.
Go on. Pull it in.

9
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,479
Deagol!

10
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:36,696
Deagol?

11
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,489
Deagol.

12
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,383
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

13
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,637
Why?

14
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,975
Because...

15
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:12,900
it's my birthday and I wants it.

16
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:52,198
My precious.

17
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,675
They cursed us.

18
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,220
Murderer.

19
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,844
"Murderer" they called us.

20
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:11,806
They cursed us and drove us away.

21
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,645
Gollum.

22
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,522
Gollum.

23
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,647
Gollum.

24
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,197
And we wept, precious.

25
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:28,948
We wept to be so alone.

26
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:35,322
- and cool
- So nice for feet

27
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:40,718
And we only wish To catch a fish

28
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:44,131
So juicy sweet

29
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,016
And we forgot the taste of bread...

30
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,660
the sound of trees...

31
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,893
the softness of the wind.

32
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:08,196
We even forgot our own name.

33
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:22,748
My precious.

34
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,246
Wake up!

35
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,960
Wake up!

36
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,860
Wake up, sleepies.

37
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,968
We must go, yes.

38
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,808
We must go at once.

39
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,437
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

40
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,188
I've gone and had too much.

41
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,313
Must be getting late.

42
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:34,983
No.

43
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:37,065
It isn't.

44
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:40,278
It isn't midday yet.

45
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:43,027
The days are growing darker.

46
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,501
Come on!

47
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,164
Must go! No time!

48
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,713
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

49
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,690
No time to lose, silly.

50
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,881
Here.

51
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,854
What about you?

52
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,398
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

53
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,366
Sam.

54
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:24,495
All right.

55
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:27,153
We don't have that much left.

56
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,202
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

57
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,296
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

58
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,875
I've rationed it.

59
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,043
There should be enough.

60
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,418
For what?

61
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,841
The journey home.

62
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,015
Come, Hobbitses.

63
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,276
Very close now.

64
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:02,696
Very close to Mordor.

65
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,534
No safe places here.

66
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,860
Hurry.

67
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:01,963
It's good.

68
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,625
Definitely from the Shire.

69
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:08,967
Longbottom Leaf.

70
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,640
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

71
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:22,981
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

72
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:27,730
Putting my feet up on a
settle after a hard day's work.

73
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,774
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

74
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,625
Welcome, my lords...

75
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,041
to Isengard!

76
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,109
You young rascals! A
merry hunt you've led us on...

77
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:59,128
...and now we find you
feasting and... and smoking!

78
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,687
We are sitting on a field of victory...

79
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:06,301
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

80
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:11,276
The salted pork is particularly good.

81
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:14,196
Salted pork?

82
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,825
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

83
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,831
who's taken over management of Isengard.

84
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,378
Young Master Gandalf.

85
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:32,126
I'm glad you've come.

86
00:11:32,302 --> 00:11:36,713
Wood and water, stock
and stone I can master.

87
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:40,554
But there is a wizard to manage here...

88
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,719
locked in his tower.

89
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,585
Show yourself.

90
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,609
Be careful.

91
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,153
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

92
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,443
Well, let's just have his
head and be done with it.

93
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,586
No.

94
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:59,316
We need him alive.

95
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,774
We need him to talk.

96
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,475
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

97
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,573
and made peace afterwards.

98
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:15,603
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

99
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,978
Can we not have peace, you and I?

100
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,062
We shall have peace.

101
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:25,259
We shall have peace...

102
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:29,472
when you answer for the
burning of the Westfold...

103
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,460
...and the children that lie dead there!

104
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:37,277
We shall have peace when
the lives of the soldiers...

105
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,523
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

106
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:43,125
...against the gates of
the Hornburg, are avenged!

107
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:50,264
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

108
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,593
we shall have peace.

109
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,893
Gibbets and crows?

110
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,651
Dotard!

111
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:05,024
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

112
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,651
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

113
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:11,368
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

114
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:15,534
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

115
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,660
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

116
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,354
Thousands more are now at risk.

117
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,751
But you could save them, Saruman.

118
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:26,211
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

119
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,670
So you have come here for information.

120
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:32,382
I have some for you.

121
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,807
Something festers in
the heart of Middle-earth.

122
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,223
Something that you have failed to see.

123
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,235
But the Great Eye has seen it.

124
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,982
Even now he presses his advantage.

125
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,079
His attack will come soon.

126
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,416
You're all going to die.

127
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,911
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

128
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:13,968
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

129
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:20,683
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

130
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:25,227
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

131
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,356
those he professes to love.

132
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:33,945
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

133
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:37,264
before you sent him to his doom?

134
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:44,289
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

135
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,784
I've heard enough!

136
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,787
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

137
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,956
No.

138
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,631
Come down, Saruman...

139
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,906
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

140
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,410
I have no use for it!

141
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,940
Saruman...

142
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:14,152
your staff is broken.

143
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,492
Grima, you need not follow him.

144
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,338
You were not always as you are now.

145
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:35,340
You were once a Man of Rohan.

146
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,901
Come down.

147
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,631
A Man of Rohan?

148
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,796
What is the house of Rohan...

149
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:46,639
but a thatched barn where
brigands drink in the reek...

150
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,511
and their brats roll on
the floor with the dogs?

151
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:57,476
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

152
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:02,690
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

153
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,744
Grima...

154
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,454
come down.

155
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,202
Be free of him.

156
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:15,373
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

157
00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:18,376
Get down, cur!

158
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,415
Saruman!

159
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:24,215
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

160
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:26,881
Tell us what you know!

161
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:33,634
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

162
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:37,348
I will not be held prisoner here.

163
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,207
Send word to all our allies...

164
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:09,336
...and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

165
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,761
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

166
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:35,903
The filth of Saruman...

167
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:39,913
is washing away.

168
00:17:40,086 --> 00:17:44,628
Trees will come back to live here.

169
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,290
Young trees.

170
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,521
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

171
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,456
Bless my bark!

172
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,354
Peregrin Took!

173
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,147
I'll take that, my lad.

174
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,194
Quickly, now.

175
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:03,955
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

176
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,665
Hail the victorious dead.

177
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,246
Hail!

178
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,109
No pauses.

179
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:25,472
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

180
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,638
So it's a drinking game?

181
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,253
Last one standing wins.

182
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,293
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

183
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,492
To victory!

184
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,118
[Rohirric] <i>Westu Aragorn hál.</i>
[English] Be-thou Aragorn well!

185
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,558
I am happy for you.

186
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:28,236
He is an honorable man.

187
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,265
You are both honorable men.

188
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,185
It was not Theoden of Rohan...

189
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,922
...who led our people to victory.

190
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,299
Don't listen to me.

191
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,636
You are young.

192
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,415
And tonight is for you.

193
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,313
Here, here.

194
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:16,582
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

195
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,330
I feel something.

196
00:21:25,423 --> 00:21:27,912
A slight tingle in my fingers.

197
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,017
I think it's affecting me.

198
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,639
What did I say?

199
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:37,469
He can't hold his liquor.

200
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:46,187
Game over.

201
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,529
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

202
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:53,693
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

203
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:58,093
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

204
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:02,289
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

205
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:05,956
But the only brew for the brave and true

206
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,619
Pippin!

207
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:13,207
But the only brew for the brave and true

208
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:16,356
Comes from The Green Dragon

209
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,378
Thank you! I win!

210
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,236
No news of Frodo?

211
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:27,384
No word.

212
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:28,995
Nothing.

213
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:32,564
We have time.

214
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:37,601
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

215
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,376
Do we know that?

216
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,894
What does your heart tell you?

217
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,988
That Frodo is alive.

218
00:22:58,393 --> 00:22:59,402
Yes.

219
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,593
Yes, he's alive.

220
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,761
Too risky. Too risky.

221
00:23:09,907 --> 00:23:11,152
Thieves.

222
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:13,374
They stole it from us.

223
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,238
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

224
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,121
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

225
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,833
Mustn't ruin it now.

226
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,076
But they knows.

227
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,125
They knows.

228
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:31,916
They suspects us.

229
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,520
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

230
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,426
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

231
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,470
No. Not.

232
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:47,889
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

233
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:52,892
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

234
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,606
And we will.

235
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,044
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

236
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,864
It's ours!

237
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,042
Ours!

238
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,663
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

239
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:15,728
Patience! Patience, my love.

240
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:20,802
First we must lead them to her.

241
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:26,685
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

242
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:29,520
Yes, the stairs. And then?

243
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,627
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

244
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:39,273
until we come to the tunnel.

245
00:24:39,783 --> 00:24:42,774
And when they go in...

246
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,869
there's no coming out.

247
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:49,672
She's always hungry.

248
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,528
She alway needs...

249
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:54,458
...to feed.

250
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,079
She must eat.

251
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,469
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

252
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:01,439
And they doesn't taste very
nice, does they, precious?

253
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:03,128
No.

254
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:08,041
Not very nice at all, my love.

255
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:11,396
She hungers for sweeter meats.

256
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,248
Hobbit meat.

257
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:18,689
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

258
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:21,652
...then we will find it.

259
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,148
And take it for me!

260
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,619
For us.

261
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:32,908
Yes. We meant "for us."

262
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:35,399
Gollum. Gollum.

263
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:41,122
The precious will be ours...

264
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:46,127
once the Hobbitses are dead!

265
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,734
You treacherous little toad!

266
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,760
No! No! Master!

267
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:54,558
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

268
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:58,246
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

269
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,721
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

270
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,672
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

271
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:08,571
...who hates Smeagol...

272
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:11,151
...and who makes up nasty lies.

273
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:14,078
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

274
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,900
Sam!

275
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,755
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

276
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:23,288
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

277
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:26,629
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

278
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,527
You don't see it, do you?

279
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:30,401
He's a villain.

280
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:34,801
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

281
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:38,127
I need you on my side.

282
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,820
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

283
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:46,061
I know, Sam. I know.

284
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,880
Trust me.

285
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,470
Come, Smeagol.

286
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:00,741
What time is it?

287
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,499
Not yet dawn.

288
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,288
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

289
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:18,142
...climbing over green
lands and above the hills.

290
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,237
I stood upon the brink.

291
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,327
It was utterly dark in
the abyss before my feet.

292
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,188
A light shone behind me...

293
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,223
...but I could not turn.

294
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,472
I could only stand there, waiting.

295
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:41,998
Night changes many thoughts.

296
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:44,485
Sleep, Eowyn.

297
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,173
Sleep...

298
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,874
...while you can.

299
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:18,361
The stars are veiled.

300
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,586
Something stirs in the east.

301
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:26,704
A sleepless malice.

302
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,488
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

303
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:47,610
What are you doing?

304
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:53,569
Pippin!

305
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,029
Pippin?

306
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:17,487
Pippin.

307
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:20,205
- Are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

308
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:21,730
Just one more time.

309
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,585
Put it back.

310
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,757
Pippin.

311
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:43,827
No!

312
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:50,732
Pippin.

313
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:55,406
He is here.

314
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:57,719
I see you.

315
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,132
Pippin!

316
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:19,411
Help! Gandalf!

317
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,276
Someone help him!

318
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:30,994
Pippin!

319
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:32,930
Fool of a Took!

320
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:56,012
Look at me.

321
00:31:58,672 --> 00:31:59,950
Gandalf...

322
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:01,835
...forgive me.

323
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:04,322
Look at me.

324
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:06,636
What did you see?

325
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,276
A tree.

326
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,810
There was a white tree...

327
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:16,771
...in a courtyard of stone.

328
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,817
It was dead.

329
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:26,691
The city was burning.

330
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:30,547
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

331
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:33,041
I saw...

332
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:37,960
I saw him.

333
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,922
I could hear his voice in my head.

334
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:45,484
And what did you tell him?

335
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,668
Speak!

336
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,893
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

337
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:56,607
He hurt me.

338
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,360
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

339
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:04,789
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

340
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:07,634
A fool...

341
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,408
...but an honest fool he remains.

342
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,817
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

343
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:18,021
We've been strangely fortunate.

344
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:22,060
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

345
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:27,259
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

346
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:30,901
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

347
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,889
He knows the heir of
Elendil has come forth.

348
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:36,227
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

349
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:40,164
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

350
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:42,274
Sauron fears this.

351
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:46,936
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

352
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,366
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

353
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:53,508
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

354
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,997
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

355
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:00,475
Tell me...

356
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:05,613
...why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

357
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,037
What do we owe Gondor?

358
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,097
- I will go.
- No!

359
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,373
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

360
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,250
You must come to Minas
Tirith by another road.

361
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:28,259
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

362
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:31,322
Understand this:

363
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,165
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

364
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,901
I ride for Minas Tirith...

365
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,750
and I won't be going alone.

366
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:49,227
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

367
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:51,847
Hurry! Hurry!

368
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:54,678
Where are we going?

369
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,097
Why did you look?

370
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,872
Why do you always have to look?

371
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,123
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

372
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,381
I'm sorry, all right?

373
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,239
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

374
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:11,861
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

375
00:35:12,332 --> 00:35:16,080
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

376
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:20,066
And you...? You're coming with me?

377
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,770
Merry?

378
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:25,075
Come on.

379
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,112
How far is Minas Tirith?

380
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:34,758
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

381
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:38,482
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

382
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:40,513
Here.

383
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,330
Something for the road.

384
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:45,311
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

385
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:49,332
I know you've run out. You
smoke too much, Pippin.

386
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:52,336
But... But we'll see each other soon.

387
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,355
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

388
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:02,967
- I don't know what's going to happen.
- Merry.

389
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:04,181
Run, Shadowfax.

390
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,850
Show us the meaning of haste.

391
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,785
Merry!

392
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,270
Merry!

393
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,204
He's always followed me...

394
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:33,991
...everywhere I went...

395
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,026
...since before we were tweens.

396
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,712
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

397
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:43,440
...but I was always there to get him out.

398
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,461
Now he's gone.

399
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:52,146
Just like Frodo and Sam.

400
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:55,526
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

401
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:57,560
They're a most hardy folk.

402
00:36:58,124 --> 00:37:01,824
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

403
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:18,677
Take her by the safest road.

404
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,346
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

405
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:24,993
It waits to carry her across the sea.

406
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:28,600
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

407
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,598
There is nothing for you here...

408
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,367
...only death.

409
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:48,962
Lady Arwen...

410
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:51,607
...we cannot delay.

411
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,623
My lady!

412
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,491
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

413
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,646
You have the gift of foresight.

414
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,749
What did you see?

415
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:25,631
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

416
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:28,371
But there is also life.

417
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:34,259
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

418
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:37,199
That future is almost gone.

419
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,662
But it is not lost.

420
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,417
Nothing is certain.

421
00:39:46,098 --> 00:39:48,804
Some things are certain.

422
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:55,442
If I leave him now...

423
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:58,173
I will regret it forever.

424
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:01,624
It is time.

425
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:10,626
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

426
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:14,319
A light from the shadow shall spring

427
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:17,810
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

428
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:28,205
The crownless again shall be king

429
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,946
Re-forge the sword.

430
00:40:35,702 --> 00:40:37,203
[Sindarin] <i>Ada.</i>
[English] Father.

431
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,596
Your hands are cold.

432
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,200
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

433
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:23,477
This was my choice.

434
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,423
[Sindarin] <i>Ada...</i>
[English] Father...

435
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:27,736
Whether by your will or not...

436
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:33,291
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

437
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:22,614
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

438
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,131
Minas Tirith.

439
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,004
City of kings.

440
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:13,296
Make way!

441
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:44,455
It's the tree.

442
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,280
Gandalf. Gandalf.

443
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:48,806
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

444
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:50,658
The tree of the king.

445
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:53,354
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

446
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,246
He is a steward only, a
caretaker of the throne.

447
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,574
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

448
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,844
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

449
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:08,786
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

450
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,391
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

451
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:18,080
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

452
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:54,780
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

453
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:04,886
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

454
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,372
Perhaps you come to explain this.

455
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:19,535
Perhaps you come to tell
me why my son is dead.

456
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,985
Boromir died to save us...

457
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:38,817
...my kinsman and me.

458
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:42,540
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

459
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:51,427
I offer you my service, such as it is...

460
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:54,020
...in payment of this debt.

461
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,544
This is my first command to you.

462
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,561
How did you escape and my son did not...

463
00:46:04,124 --> 00:46:06,450
...so mighty a man as he was?

464
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,303
The mightiest man may
be slain by one arrow...

465
00:46:10,555 --> 00:46:12,464
and Boromir was pierced by many.

466
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:17,920
Get up.

467
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:19,753
My lord...

468
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:23,132
...there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

469
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,195
...but it is not now.

470
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:28,301
War is coming.

471
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:30,704
The enemy is on your doorstep.

472
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,118
As steward, you are charged...

473
00:46:33,143 --> 00:46:36,410
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

474
00:46:37,535 --> 00:46:39,677
You still have friends.

475
00:46:39,702 --> 00:46:42,272
You are not alone in this fight.

476
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:45,135
Send word to Theoden of Rohan.

477
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:46,883
Light the beacons.

478
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:52,074
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

479
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:55,448
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

480
00:46:57,563 --> 00:47:01,285
Do you think the eyes of
the White Tower are blind?

481
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:04,987
I have seen more than you know.

482
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,363
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

483
00:47:08,507 --> 00:47:11,377
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

484
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:15,283
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

485
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:21,264
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

486
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:26,273
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

487
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:30,944
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

488
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:36,620
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

489
00:47:37,562 --> 00:47:41,974
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

490
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:48,492
Come.

491
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:59,159
All has turned to vain ambition.

492
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,036
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

493
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:08,576
A thousand years this city has stood.

494
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,990
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

495
00:48:13,218 --> 00:48:15,424
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

496
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:17,212
...will never bloom again.

497
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,638
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

498
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,126
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

499
00:48:24,344 --> 00:48:28,197
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

500
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:31,035
...before it fell into decay.

501
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:35,316
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

502
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,585
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

503
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,818
...and counted the old
names of their descent...

504
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:44,182
...dearer than the names of their sons.

505
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,597
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

506
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:54,447
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

507
00:48:55,657 --> 00:48:59,441
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

508
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,756
The line of kings failed.

509
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,981
The White Tree withered.

510
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,580
The rule of Gondor was
given over to lesser men.

511
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,836
Mordor.

512
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,875
Yes, there it lies.

513
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:31,208
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

514
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:34,812
A storm is coming.

515
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:38,316
This is not the weather of the world.

516
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:40,694
This is a device of Sauron's making.

517
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,329
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

518
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:47,659
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

519
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:49,870
...so he covers the face of the sun...

520
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:53,433
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

521
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:56,716
When the Shadow of
Mordor reaches this city...

522
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,704
...it will begin.

523
00:50:01,228 --> 00:50:02,806
Well...

524
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:04,530
...Minas Tirith...

525
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:07,810
...very impressive.

526
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:10,904
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

527
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,300
There's no leaving this city.

528
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:18,656
Help must come to us.

529
00:50:20,134 --> 00:50:22,803
It must be getting near teatime.

530
00:50:22,828 --> 00:50:26,529
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

531
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:30,577
We're not in decent places.

532
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,319
Mr. Frodo?

533
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,607
What is it?

534
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:46,285
It's just a feeling.

535
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:50,609
I don't think I'll be coming back.

536
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,948
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

537
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:00,385
That's just morbid thinking.

538
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,231
We're going there and back again...

539
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:05,545
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

540
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,979
You'll see.

541
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:20,721
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

542
00:51:25,072 --> 00:51:29,116
Long ago, when there was a king.

543
00:51:49,742 --> 00:51:52,576
Mr. Frodo, look.

544
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:57,035
The king has got a crown again.

545
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:12,265
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

546
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:32,855
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

547
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,127
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

548
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:41,658
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

549
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:45,053
You'll have to do as
you're told, Peregrin Took.

550
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:51,911
Ridiculous Hobbit.

551
00:52:53,025 --> 00:52:55,231
Guard of the Citadel.

552
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,238
There's no more stars.

553
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:19,993
Is it time?

554
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,782
Yes.

555
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,279
It's so quiet.

556
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:32,442
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

557
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,699
I don't want to be in a battle...

558
00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:42,286
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

559
00:53:45,897 --> 00:53:49,514
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

560
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,992
There never was much hope.

561
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:57,497
Just a fool's hope.

562
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:05,952
Our enemy is ready.

563
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:09,357
His full strength's gathered.

564
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:12,663
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

565
00:54:12,688 --> 00:54:15,724
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

566
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,752
...mercenaries from the coast.

567
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:21,696
All will answer Mordor's call.

568
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,431
Come on.

569
00:54:24,576 --> 00:54:27,909
This will be the end of
Gondor as we know it.

570
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:31,384
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

571
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,310
If the river is taken...

572
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,838
...if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

573
00:54:36,863 --> 00:54:40,209
...the last defense of
this city will be gone.

574
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:44,692
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

575
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:52,264
Gandalf?

576
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:59,814
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

577
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,964
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

578
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:09,150
The one they say no living man can kill.

579
00:55:10,283 --> 00:55:12,441
The Witch King of Angmar.

580
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:15,788
You've met him before.

581
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:19,266
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

582
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,486
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

583
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,967
...the greatest of the Nine.

584
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:35,116
Minas Morgul is his lair.

585
00:55:38,593 --> 00:55:42,127
The Dead City.

586
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:47,613
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

587
00:55:54,714 --> 00:55:56,872
Quick. Quick.

588
00:55:57,064 --> 00:56:01,062
They will see. They will see.

589
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:15,406
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

590
00:56:15,879 --> 00:56:19,298
The way into Mordor.

591
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:23,806
The secret stair.

592
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:26,968
Climb.

593
00:56:47,182 --> 00:56:49,934
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

594
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,444
- What's it doing?
- No.

595
00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:00,159
- They're calling me.
- No.

596
00:57:30,465 --> 00:57:33,419
Hide! Hide!

597
00:58:17,095 --> 00:58:19,031
I can feel his blade.

598
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:33,745
We come to it at last.

599
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:38,481
The great battle of our time.

600
00:59:17,745 --> 00:59:20,994
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

601
00:59:30,851 --> 00:59:32,949
The board is set.

602
00:59:33,877 --> 00:59:36,442
The pieces are moving.

603
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,620
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

604
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:44,486
And then it's into the tunnel.

605
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,716
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

606
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:50,844
You listen to me, and
you listen good and proper.

607
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:54,262
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

608
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,958
One sniff something's not right...

609
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:59,202
...one hair stands up on
the back of my head, it's over.

610
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:02,205
No more slinker. No more stinker.

611
01:00:02,483 --> 01:00:05,106
You're gone. Got it?

612
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:08,100
I'm watching you.

613
01:00:13,226 --> 01:00:15,218
What was that about?

614
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,976
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

615
01:00:24,502 --> 01:00:27,373
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

616
01:00:27,766 --> 01:00:32,343
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

617
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:38,690
You must not fail me.

618
01:01:12,883 --> 01:01:15,526
It's been very quiet across the river.

619
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:18,168
The Orcs are lying low.

620
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,571
The garrison may have moved out.

621
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:24,290
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

622
01:01:24,678 --> 01:01:27,962
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

623
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:54,594
Quiet.

624
01:01:58,498 --> 01:02:00,456
We need 10 more.

625
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,156
Kill him!

626
01:02:40,604 --> 01:02:43,010
They're not coming from the north.

627
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:48,835
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

628
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:53,962
Faster.

629
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,261
Draw swords.

630
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:06,424
Hold! Hold them!

631
01:05:26,473 --> 01:05:27,477
What?

632
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,716
Amon Din

633
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:51,524
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

634
01:05:54,598 --> 01:05:58,102
Hope is kindled.

635
01:07:31,377 --> 01:07:33,077
The beacons of Minas Tirith!

636
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:35,543
The beacons are lit!

637
01:07:36,795 --> 01:07:38,418
Gondor calls for aid.

638
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:50,910
And Rohan will answer.

639
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,520
Muster the Rohirrim.

640
01:08:10,038 --> 01:08:12,012
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

641
01:08:12,408 --> 01:08:14,323
As many men as can be found.

642
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,680
You have two days.

643
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:19,581
On the third, we ride for Gondor...

644
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:21,424
...and war.

645
01:08:23,108 --> 01:08:24,735
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

646
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,300
- Gamling.
- My lord.

647
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:28,118
Make haste across the Riddermark.

648
01:08:28,143 --> 01:08:30,120
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

649
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:31,345
I will.

650
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:39,198
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

651
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:43,204
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

652
01:08:49,774 --> 01:08:51,693
The men have found their captain.

653
01:08:52,035 --> 01:08:55,376
They will follow you
into battle, even to death.

654
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:56,979
You have given us hope.

655
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,169
Excuse me.

656
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:04,989
I have a sword.

657
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,696
Please accept it.

658
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:12,477
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

659
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:17,681
And gladly I accept it.

660
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:23,076
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

661
01:09:27,813 --> 01:09:29,014
Horse-Men.

662
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:35,241
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

663
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:38,438
Your kinsmen may have
no need to ride to war.

664
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:42,363
I fear war already marches 
on their own lands.

665
01:10:00,808 --> 01:10:04,434
So it is before the walls 
of Minas Tirith...

666
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:08,325
...the doom of our time will be decided.

667
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:12,606
Now is the hour.

668
01:10:12,631 --> 01:10:16,351
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

669
01:10:16,443 --> 01:10:19,977
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

670
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,056
Faramir!

671
01:11:11,502 --> 01:11:15,203
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

672
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:18,901
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

673
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,164
The Nazgul.

674
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:33,714
Take cover!

675
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:36,251
Nazgul!

676
01:11:37,435 --> 01:11:41,160
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

677
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:49,618
Fall back!

678
01:11:56,382 --> 01:12:00,961
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

679
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:28,041
The age of Men...

680
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:29,521
...is over.

681
01:12:30,191 --> 01:12:32,862
The time of the Orc...

682
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,552
...has come.

683
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:40,237
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

684
01:12:42,005 --> 01:12:44,377
Take cover, my lord!

685
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:45,812
It's coming!

686
01:12:51,613 --> 01:12:52,990
It's Mithrandir.

687
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:55,108
It's The White Rider!

688
01:13:35,026 --> 01:13:36,401
Pull!

689
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,763
Mithrandir.

690
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:58,200
They broke through our defenses.

691
01:13:58,593 --> 01:14:00,799
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

692
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,969
Battalions of Orcs
are crossing the river.

693
01:14:03,994 --> 01:14:06,112
It is as the Lord
Denethor predicted.

694
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:07,903
Long has he
foreseen this doom.

695
01:14:07,994 --> 01:14:10,201
Foreseen and done nothing.

696
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:16,592
Faramir?

697
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:21,505
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

698
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:23,469
No.

699
01:14:26,015 --> 01:14:27,778
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

700
01:14:28,493 --> 01:14:30,376
Where? When?

701
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:32,015
In Ithilien.

702
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,116
Not two days ago.

703
01:14:34,585 --> 01:14:35,685
Gandalf...

704
01:14:35,912 --> 01:14:38,401
...they're taking the road 
to the Morgul Vale.

705
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,491
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

706
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:46,124
What does that mean?

707
01:14:47,146 --> 01:14:48,873
What's wrong?

708
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:51,796
Faramir, tell me everything.

709
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,273
Tell me all you know.

710
01:14:55,238 --> 01:14:58,653
This is how you would serve your city?

711
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,385
You would risk its utter ruin?

712
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:05,114
I did what I judged to be right.

713
01:15:05,695 --> 01:15:08,697
What you judged to be right.

714
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:12,273
You sent the Ring
of Power into Mordor.

715
01:15:12,297 --> 01:15:14,798
In the hands of
a witless Halfling.

716
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:24,008
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

717
01:15:25,513 --> 01:15:27,055
Hidden.

718
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:30,273
Dark and deep in the vaults...

719
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,751
...not to be used.

720
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:38,034
Unless...

721
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,952
...at the uttermost end of need.

722
01:15:42,103 --> 01:15:44,142
I would not use the Ring.

723
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:47,455
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

724
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:52,720
Ever you desire to appear
lordly and gracious...

725
01:15:52,745 --> 01:15:54,987
...as a king of old.

726
01:15:56,834 --> 01:16:00,584
Boromir would have remembered 
his father's need.

727
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:03,703
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

728
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:06,267
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

729
01:16:06,571 --> 01:16:09,747
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

730
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:12,582
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

731
01:16:14,096 --> 01:16:15,620
And when he returned...

732
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,890
...you would not have known your son.

733
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:21,577
Boromir was loyal to me!

734
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:24,422
Not some wizard's pupil!

735
01:16:32,614 --> 01:16:33,942
Father?

736
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:48,430
My son.

737
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,231
Leave me.

738
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,355
Careful, master. Careful.

739
01:17:52,642 --> 01:17:55,560
Very far to fall.

740
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:02,104
Very dangerous are the stairs.

741
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,338
Come, master.

742
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:15,734
Come to Smeagol.

743
01:18:22,383 --> 01:18:23,877
Mr. Frodo.

744
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:26,411
Get back, you!

745
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:29,015
Don't touch him!

746
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:35,640
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

747
01:18:36,024 --> 01:18:38,656
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

748
01:18:39,984 --> 01:18:41,006
Master?

749
01:18:43,096 --> 01:18:46,426
Master carries heavy burden.

750
01:18:46,663 --> 01:18:51,604
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

751
01:18:52,369 --> 01:18:55,620
Fat one cannot know.

752
01:18:57,528 --> 01:19:00,278
Smeagol look after master.

753
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:02,946
He wants it.

754
01:19:03,936 --> 01:19:05,091
He needs it.

755
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,605
Smeagol sees it in his eye.

756
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,985
Very soon he will ask you for it.

757
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,853
You will see.

758
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:18,150
The fat one will take it from you.

759
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:29,247
Send forth all legions.

760
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:34,205
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

761
01:19:34,696 --> 01:19:36,625
Slay them all.

762
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:40,916
What of the wizard?

763
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:45,126
I will break him.

764
01:19:48,673 --> 01:19:50,715
Where are Theoden's riders?

765
01:19:51,138 --> 01:19:53,154
Will Rohan's army come?

766
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,291
Mithrandir.

767
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:01,006
Courage is the best defense 
that you have now.

768
01:20:05,795 --> 01:20:08,499
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

769
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:16,119
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

770
01:20:16,496 --> 01:20:17,991
It was well-done.

771
01:20:21,295 --> 01:20:25,340
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

772
01:20:25,998 --> 01:20:28,537
You are to join the tower guard.

773
01:20:29,104 --> 01:20:31,990
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

774
01:20:32,181 --> 01:20:34,636
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

775
01:20:34,787 --> 01:20:36,329
A very foolish one...

776
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:40,745
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

777
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,755
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

778
01:20:43,893 --> 01:20:45,683
My father had it made for me.

779
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:48,124
Well...

780
01:20:48,383 --> 01:20:50,374
I'm taller than you were then.

781
01:20:50,405 --> 01:20:52,685
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore...

782
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,012
...except sideways.

783
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:58,676
Never fitted me either.

784
01:20:58,906 --> 01:21:01,742
Boromir was always the soldier.

785
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,007
They were so alike, he and my father.

786
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:10,856
Proud.

787
01:21:10,983 --> 01:21:12,182
Stubborn even.

788
01:21:14,005 --> 01:21:15,499
But strong.

789
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,187
I think you have strength 
of a different kind.

790
01:21:20,862 --> 01:21:23,317
And one day your father will see it.

791
01:21:27,414 --> 01:21:30,915
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

792
01:21:31,396 --> 01:21:32,891
...in peace or war...

793
01:21:33,525 --> 01:21:35,980
...in living or dying...

794
01:21:37,414 --> 01:21:38,658
...from...

795
01:21:41,294 --> 01:21:44,080
From this hour henceforth...

796
01:21:44,128 --> 01:21:46,037
...until my lord release me...

797
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:49,915
...or death take me.

798
01:21:50,463 --> 01:21:52,954
And I shall not forget it...

799
01:21:53,132 --> 01:21:56,502
nor fail to reward that which is given.

800
01:22:04,134 --> 01:22:06,423
Fealty with love.

801
01:22:07,472 --> 01:22:09,133
Valor with honor.

802
01:22:10,687 --> 01:22:12,575
Disloyalty...

803
01:22:12,605 --> 01:22:14,025
...with vengeance.

804
01:22:22,686 --> 01:22:26,779
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

805
01:22:26,804 --> 01:22:30,095
...defenses that your brother 
long held intact.

806
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,167
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

807
01:22:32,192 --> 01:22:34,979
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

808
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,069
Osgiliath must be retaken.

809
01:22:37,314 --> 01:22:39,355
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

810
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,926
Much must be risked in war.

811
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:49,304
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

812
01:22:55,696 --> 01:22:58,946
You wish now that our
places had been exchanged...

813
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:02,744
...that I had died and Boromir had lived.

814
01:23:06,192 --> 01:23:07,192
Yes.

815
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,038
I wish that.

816
01:23:19,278 --> 01:23:21,769
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

817
01:23:23,496 --> 01:23:26,414
I will do what I can in his stead.

818
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,753
If I should return...

819
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,728
...think better of me, Father.

820
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,801
That will depend on the
manner of your return.

821
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:10,345
What are you up to?

822
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,614
Sneaking off, are we?

823
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,849
Sneaking?

824
01:25:15,379 --> 01:25:17,537
Sneaking?

825
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,146
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

826
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:27,366
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

827
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:29,693
and they say "sneak."

828
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:32,880
Sneak?

829
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:36,189
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

830
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,836
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

831
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:42,330
You just startled me is all.

832
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,831
What were you doing?

833
01:25:46,386 --> 01:25:48,508
Sneaking.

834
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,967
Fine. Have it your own way.

835
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:56,418
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

836
01:25:57,144 --> 01:25:59,100
We have to be moving on.

837
01:26:04,222 --> 01:26:05,800
It's dark still.

838
01:26:06,074 --> 01:26:08,281
It's always dark here.

839
01:26:12,533 --> 01:26:14,441
It's gone!

840
01:26:15,764 --> 01:26:18,634
- The Elven bread.
- What?

841
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:19,784
That's all we have left.

842
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:26,717
He took it. He must have!

843
01:26:27,019 --> 01:26:30,270
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

844
01:26:30,295 --> 01:26:33,213
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

845
01:26:33,382 --> 01:26:36,548
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

846
01:26:36,718 --> 01:26:38,260
He doesn't eat it.

847
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:41,587
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

848
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,468
What's this?

849
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:50,479
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

850
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:52,851
He took it.

851
01:26:53,693 --> 01:26:57,903
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

852
01:26:58,072 --> 01:26:59,864
That's a filthy lie!

853
01:27:00,032 --> 01:27:02,239
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

854
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:03,655
- Sam!
- Call me...

855
01:27:03,828 --> 01:27:05,073
Stop it!

856
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,278
Sam!

857
01:27:08,582 --> 01:27:12,199
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

858
01:27:13,253 --> 01:27:18,793
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

859
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,090
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

860
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:23,337
- I'm all right.
- No.

861
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:26,597
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

862
01:27:26,765 --> 01:27:28,888
It's that Gollum.

863
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:30,768
It's this place.

864
01:27:30,936 --> 01:27:33,509
It's that thing around your neck.

865
01:27:37,027 --> 01:27:38,307
I could help a bit.

866
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,154
I could carry it for a while.

867
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:43,065
Carry it for a while.

868
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,485
I could carry it... I could carry it.

869
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:50,573
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

870
01:27:50,747 --> 01:27:51,947
Get away!

871
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,701
I don't want to keep it.

872
01:27:57,296 --> 01:27:59,287
I just want to help.

873
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,963
See? See?

874
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:07,551
He wants it for himself.

875
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:09,430
Shut up, you!

876
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:11,801
Go away! Get out of here!

877
01:28:11,976 --> 01:28:13,803
No, Sam.

878
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:15,223
It's you.

879
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,149
I'm sorry, Sam.

880
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,194
But he's a liar.

881
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:27,032
He's poisoned you against me.

882
01:28:28,451 --> 01:28:30,359
You can't help me anymore.

883
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:34,202
You don't mean that.

884
01:28:36,709 --> 01:28:38,499
Go home.

885
01:29:58,537 --> 01:30:00,328
Faramir!

886
01:30:00,497 --> 01:30:02,406
Faramir!

887
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:05,957
Your father's will has turned to madness.

888
01:30:07,127 --> 01:30:09,167
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

889
01:30:09,922 --> 01:30:12,248
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

890
01:30:12,884 --> 01:30:15,802
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

891
01:30:16,429 --> 01:30:19,216
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

892
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,593
her memory, her wisdom.

893
01:30:24,978 --> 01:30:28,395
Your father loves you, Faramir.

894
01:30:29,108 --> 01:30:32,109
He will remember it before the end.

895
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:43,261
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

896
01:31:46,244 --> 01:31:47,738
Well...

897
01:31:48,288 --> 01:31:49,912
yes.

898
01:31:50,624 --> 01:31:54,371
At least, well enough for my own people.

899
01:31:56,004 --> 01:31:58,411
But we have no songs for great halls...

900
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:00,710
and evil times.

901
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:04,717
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

902
01:32:07,514 --> 01:32:08,925
Come, sing me a song.

903
01:32:19,986 --> 01:32:23,318
Home is behind

904
01:32:23,487 --> 01:32:27,236
The world ahead

905
01:32:29,661 --> 01:32:35,496
And there are many paths to tread

906
01:32:37,292 --> 01:32:40,827
Through shadow

907
01:32:41,004 --> 01:32:45,168
To the edge of night

908
01:32:46,844 --> 01:32:51,921
Until the stars are all alight

909
01:32:54,935 --> 01:32:59,263
Mist and shadow

910
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,732
Cloud and shade

911
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:09,446
All shall fade

912
01:33:11,826 --> 01:33:15,823
All shall

913
01:33:21,586 --> 01:33:23,958
Fade

914
01:33:48,361 --> 01:33:51,812
March! March!

915
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:57,197
March! March! March!

916
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,991
Make way for the king.

917
01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:06,493
Make way.

918
01:34:08,963 --> 01:34:11,003
The king is here.

919
01:34:12,968 --> 01:34:14,593
My lord.

920
01:34:15,847 --> 01:34:17,803
Hail to you, sire.

921
01:34:18,266 --> 01:34:19,462
Grimbold, how many?

922
01:34:19,641 --> 01:34:22,096
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

923
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:25,730
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

924
01:34:26,856 --> 01:34:30,806
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

925
01:34:47,877 --> 01:34:50,000
Six thousand spears.

926
01:34:51,046 --> 01:34:53,039
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

927
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:56,709
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

928
01:34:59,471 --> 01:35:01,214
More will come.

929
01:35:01,598 --> 01:35:04,551
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

930
01:35:04,725 --> 01:35:07,299
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

931
01:35:26,789 --> 01:35:29,114
The horses are restless...

932
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:30,786
and the men are quiet.

933
01:35:31,252 --> 01:35:34,370
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

934
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,713
That road there...

935
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,711
where does that lead?

936
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:46,303
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

937
01:35:47,017 --> 01:35:50,017
None who venture there ever return.

938
01:35:51,228 --> 01:35:53,102
That mountain is evil.

939
01:36:16,045 --> 01:36:17,871
Aragorn.

940
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,539
Let's find some food.

941
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:38,434
There.

942
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,401
A true esquire of Rohan.

943
01:36:46,032 --> 01:36:48,023
I'm ready.

944
01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:50,898
Sorry.

945
01:36:51,079 --> 01:36:53,319
It isn't all that dangerous.

946
01:36:53,831 --> 01:36:56,156
It's not even sharp.

947
01:36:56,834 --> 01:37:00,250
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

948
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:01,915
Come on.

949
01:37:06,091 --> 01:37:08,584
To the smithy. Go!

950
01:37:10,055 --> 01:37:12,593
You should not encourage him.

951
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:15,221
You should not doubt him.

952
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:18,678
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

953
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:22,976
Why should Merry be left behind?

954
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:25,772
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

955
01:37:27,947 --> 01:37:31,113
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

956
01:37:34,369 --> 01:37:37,370
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

957
01:37:38,623 --> 01:37:40,699
When the fear takes him...

958
01:37:40,875 --> 01:37:45,918
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

959
01:37:46,298 --> 01:37:48,455
do you think he would stand and fight?

960
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:52,635
He would flee.

961
01:37:52,804 --> 01:37:54,843
And he would be right to do so.

962
01:37:57,058 --> 01:38:01,009
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

963
01:38:36,679 --> 01:38:40,380
I choose a mortal life.

964
01:38:43,311 --> 01:38:46,180
I wish I could've seen him...

965
01:38:47,314 --> 01:38:50,019
one last time.

966
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:02,613
Sir?

967
01:39:04,456 --> 01:39:07,029
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

968
01:39:27,812 --> 01:39:29,769
I take my leave.

969
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:45,656
My lord Elrond.

970
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:49,745
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

971
01:39:52,835 --> 01:39:54,828
Arwen is dying.

972
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:03,678
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

973
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:07,799
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

974
01:40:07,975 --> 01:40:11,973
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

975
01:40:12,146 --> 01:40:15,893
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

976
01:40:16,649 --> 01:40:19,223
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

977
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:21,271
The end has come.

978
01:40:21,656 --> 01:40:24,276
It will not be our end, but his.

979
01:40:25,033 --> 01:40:28,616
You ride to war, but not to victory.

980
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:33,285
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

981
01:40:33,457 --> 01:40:37,871
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

982
01:40:38,338 --> 01:40:41,754
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

983
01:40:42,384 --> 01:40:44,459
They'll be in the city in two days.

984
01:40:44,968 --> 01:40:47,803
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

985
01:40:48,513 --> 01:40:50,637
You need more men.

986
01:40:51,016 --> 01:40:52,760
There are none.

987
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,434
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

988
01:41:07,448 --> 01:41:09,607
Murderers...

989
01:41:09,784 --> 01:41:11,196
traitors.

990
01:41:13,664 --> 01:41:15,821
You would call upon them to fight?

991
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:17,576
They believe in nothing.

992
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,873
They answer to no one.

993
01:41:20,044 --> 01:41:23,128
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

994
01:41:30,262 --> 01:41:35,387
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

995
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:54,111
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

996
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:12,919
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

997
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:15,502
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

998
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:19,547
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

999
01:42:21,395 --> 01:42:23,553
Put aside the Ranger.

1000
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:27,064
Become who you were born to be.

1001
01:42:27,234 --> 01:42:29,226
Take the Dimholt road.

1002
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:35,547
[Sindarin] <i>Ónen i-Estel Edain.</i>
[English] I gave hope to Men.

1003
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:40,394
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-chebin...</i>
[English] I have kept...

1004
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,195
[Sindarin] <i>...Estel anim.</i>
[English] ...no hope for me.

1005
01:42:55,261 --> 01:42:56,922
Why are you doing this?

1006
01:42:57,388 --> 01:43:00,590
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

1007
01:43:03,018 --> 01:43:05,093
You cannot abandon the men.

1008
01:43:06,396 --> 01:43:07,973
Eowyn...

1009
01:43:08,147 --> 01:43:10,354
We need you here.

1010
01:43:11,484 --> 01:43:13,358
Why have you come?

1011
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:16,986
Do you not know?

1012
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:29,291
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

1013
01:43:33,213 --> 01:43:35,622
I cannot give you what you seek.

1014
01:43:49,146 --> 01:43:53,060
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

1015
01:44:12,209 --> 01:44:14,497
Just where do you think you're off to?

1016
01:44:14,669 --> 01:44:15,998
Not this time.

1017
01:44:16,171 --> 01:44:18,377
This time you must stay, Gimli.

1018
01:44:21,093 --> 01:44:23,928
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

1019
01:44:24,097 --> 01:44:27,760
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

1020
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:52,237
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

1021
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:54,455
Where's he going?

1022
01:44:57,044 --> 01:44:59,083
I don't understand.

1023
01:45:03,509 --> 01:45:05,300
Lord Aragorn!

1024
01:45:05,719 --> 01:45:08,423
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

1025
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:11,715
He leaves because there is no hope.

1026
01:45:12,391 --> 01:45:14,515
He leaves because he must.

1027
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:16,394
Too few have come.

1028
01:45:16,563 --> 01:45:18,721
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

1029
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:22,894
No...

1030
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:24,564
we cannot.

1031
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:31,232
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

1032
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,417
I have left instruction.

1033
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:53,345
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

1034
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,179
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1035
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:06,277
Long may you defend Edoras...

1036
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:08,770
if the battle goes ill.

1037
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:13,279
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1038
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,451
Duty?

1039
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:20,951
No.

1040
01:46:29,257 --> 01:46:31,380
I would have you smile again...

1041
01:46:34,804 --> 01:46:39,799
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1042
01:46:44,647 --> 01:46:48,146
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1043
01:46:52,488 --> 01:46:55,238
and no more despair.

1044
01:47:01,455 --> 01:47:05,155
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1045
01:47:05,334 --> 01:47:07,161
One that is cursed.

1046
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:11,666
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1047
01:47:12,089 --> 01:47:14,841
to the last king of Gondor...

1048
01:47:15,427 --> 01:47:17,004
to come to his aid...

1049
01:47:17,178 --> 01:47:18,886
to fight.

1050
01:47:19,389 --> 01:47:21,547
But when the time came...

1051
01:47:22,184 --> 01:47:24,803
when Gondor's need was dire...

1052
01:47:24,976 --> 01:47:26,850
they fled...

1053
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,390
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1054
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:33,767
And so Isildur cursed them...

1055
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:39,188
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1056
01:47:43,495 --> 01:47:46,661
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1057
01:47:47,123 --> 01:47:49,365
The forgotten people.

1058
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:52,034
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1059
01:47:52,505 --> 01:47:54,377
From the north shall he come.

1060
01:47:54,881 --> 01:47:56,540
Need shall drive him.

1061
01:47:57,634 --> 01:48:01,132
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1062
01:48:19,613 --> 01:48:22,899
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1063
01:48:28,455 --> 01:48:30,412
The way is shut.

1064
01:48:31,166 --> 01:48:33,123
It was made by those who are dead.

1065
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:35,993
And the Dead keep it.

1066
01:48:36,546 --> 01:48:38,088
The way is shut.

1067
01:48:49,434 --> 01:48:50,928
Brego!

1068
01:48:54,438 --> 01:48:57,142
I do not fear death.

1069
01:49:09,452 --> 01:49:11,860
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1070
01:49:12,038 --> 01:49:16,700
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1071
01:49:16,877 --> 01:49:18,205
Oh.

1072
01:49:18,378 --> 01:49:21,213
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1073
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:38,470
We must ride light and swift.

1074
01:49:38,647 --> 01:49:40,390
It is a long road ahead.

1075
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:43,650
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1076
01:49:49,157 --> 01:49:52,159
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1077
01:49:52,494 --> 01:49:54,486
All my friends have gone to battle.

1078
01:49:54,662 --> 01:49:56,536
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1079
01:49:56,706 --> 01:49:58,829
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1080
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,372
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1081
01:50:02,378 --> 01:50:04,501
I want to fight.

1082
01:50:05,006 --> 01:50:06,998
I will say no more.

1083
01:50:23,815 --> 01:50:25,772
Ride with me.

1084
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:28,646
My lady.

1085
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:31,192
Form up! Move out!

1086
01:50:31,365 --> 01:50:34,568
Form up! Move out!

1087
01:50:37,661 --> 01:50:38,859
Ride!

1088
01:50:39,038 --> 01:50:41,992
Ride now to Gondor!

1089
01:50:51,219 --> 01:50:52,819
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1090
01:50:54,343 --> 01:50:55,643
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1091
01:50:55,644 --> 01:50:56,244
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1092
01:50:56,245 --> 01:50:57,545
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1093
01:50:57,546 --> 01:50:58,046
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh! </i>
[English]  Louder!

1094
01:50:58,047 --> 01:50:59,347
[Black Speech] <i> Katmuda! </i>
[English]  Death to men!

1095
01:50:59,348 --> 01:51:00,848
[Black Speech] <i> Gorosh chadar! </i>
[English]  Loud enough!

1096
01:51:23,623 --> 01:51:25,366
What is it?

1097
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,083
What do you see?

1098
01:51:27,334 --> 01:51:29,457
I see shapes of men.

1099
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:33,506
And of horses.

1100
01:51:34,258 --> 01:51:35,456
Where?

1101
01:51:35,634 --> 01:51:38,588
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1102
01:51:41,015 --> 01:51:43,220
Spears rise...

1103
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:47,302
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1104
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:50,721
The Dead are following.

1105
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:53,436
They have been summoned.

1106
01:51:54,111 --> 01:51:55,937
The Dead?

1107
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:58,029
Summoned?

1108
01:51:58,448 --> 01:52:00,322
I knew that.

1109
01:52:03,661 --> 01:52:05,405
Very good.

1110
01:52:06,122 --> 01:52:08,197
Very good! Legolas!

1111
01:52:46,161 --> 01:52:47,571
Do not look down.

1112
01:53:40,171 --> 01:53:45,296
Who enters my domain?

1113
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:51,259
One who will have your allegiance.

1114
01:53:54,224 --> 01:53:59,564
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1115
01:53:59,898 --> 01:54:02,567
You will suffer me.

1116
01:54:26,088 --> 01:54:29,459
The way is shut.

1117
01:54:30,636 --> 01:54:35,095
It was made by those who are dead.

1118
01:54:35,473 --> 01:54:39,636
And the Dead keep it.

1119
01:54:48,778 --> 01:54:51,862
The way is shut.

1120
01:54:53,616 --> 01:54:56,237
Now you must die.

1121
01:55:00,122 --> 01:55:02,957
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1122
01:55:03,292 --> 01:55:08,249
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1123
01:55:13,844 --> 01:55:16,001
That line was broken.

1124
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,845
It has been remade.

1125
01:55:28,774 --> 01:55:30,317
Fight for us...

1126
01:55:30,485 --> 01:55:33,023
and regain your honor.

1127
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:38,527
What say you?

1128
01:55:50,753 --> 01:55:52,295
What say you?

1129
01:55:53,047 --> 01:55:54,839
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1130
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,175
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1131
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:01,170
I am Isildur's heir.

1132
01:56:01,724 --> 01:56:03,679
Fight for me...

1133
01:56:04,266 --> 01:56:07,849
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1134
01:56:11,774 --> 01:56:13,732
What say you?

1135
01:56:21,658 --> 01:56:23,865
You have my word!

1136
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:28,159
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1137
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:31,120
What say you?!

1138
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:37,375
Stand, you traitors!

1139
01:57:04,323 --> 01:57:05,355
Out!

1140
01:57:26,721 --> 01:57:28,299
Legolas!

1141
01:57:29,433 --> 01:57:30,630
Run!

1142
01:58:36,955 --> 01:58:39,030
We fight.

1143
01:58:49,383 --> 01:58:51,957
Open the gate! Quick!

1144
01:59:22,999 --> 01:59:24,992
Quick! Hurry!

1145
01:59:38,763 --> 01:59:40,388
Faramir!

1146
01:59:41,392 --> 01:59:44,642
Say not that he has fallen.

1147
01:59:45,813 --> 01:59:47,355
They were outnumbered.

1148
01:59:47,772 --> 01:59:49,350
None survived.

1149
01:59:50,066 --> 01:59:52,059
Fear.

1150
01:59:52,611 --> 01:59:55,814
The city is rank with it.

1151
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:00,613
Let us ease their pain.

1152
02:00:00,869 --> 02:00:02,612
Release the prisoners.

1153
02:00:02,787 --> 02:00:04,745
Catapults!

1154
02:00:18,093 --> 02:00:21,545
My sons are spent.

1155
02:00:22,598 --> 02:00:25,515
My line has ended.

1156
02:00:28,354 --> 02:00:29,765
He's alive!

1157
02:00:29,938 --> 02:00:33,104
The House of Stewards has failed.

1158
02:00:33,274 --> 02:00:34,733
He needs medicine, my lord.

1159
02:00:35,778 --> 02:00:38,446
My line has ended!

1160
02:00:39,948 --> 02:00:41,941
My lord!

1161
02:00:55,464 --> 02:00:57,290
Rohan...

1162
02:00:58,049 --> 02:01:00,455
has deserted us.

1163
02:01:14,897 --> 02:01:18,100
Theoden's betrayed me.

1164
02:01:29,246 --> 02:01:31,072
Abandon your posts!

1165
02:01:32,123 --> 02:01:36,037
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1166
02:01:46,178 --> 02:01:47,720
Prepare for battle!

1167
02:01:48,263 --> 02:01:51,429
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1168
02:01:52,601 --> 02:01:54,558
Over here!

1169
02:01:55,312 --> 02:01:57,684
Return to your posts!

1170
02:02:08,491 --> 02:02:11,112
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1171
02:02:21,295 --> 02:02:22,754
Stay where you are.

1172
02:02:39,729 --> 02:02:41,140
We need more rubble!

1173
02:02:41,314 --> 02:02:43,188
Watch out!

1174
02:02:43,358 --> 02:02:45,895
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1175
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:49,320
Double up, men!

1176
02:03:58,304 --> 02:04:01,305
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1177
02:04:01,808 --> 02:04:05,307
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1178
02:04:45,975 --> 02:04:47,599
Not at the towers!

1179
02:04:47,768 --> 02:04:50,769
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1180
02:04:51,522 --> 02:04:53,349
Bring them down!

1181
02:05:28,473 --> 02:05:30,514
Fight them back!

1182
02:05:30,685 --> 02:05:32,678
Peregrin Took!

1183
02:05:33,563 --> 02:05:36,729
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1184
02:05:52,415 --> 02:05:54,787
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1185
02:06:20,524 --> 02:06:21,984
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1186
02:06:22,611 --> 02:06:25,943
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1187
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:40,245
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1188
02:06:40,419 --> 02:06:42,376
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1189
02:06:48,718 --> 02:06:51,125
Get back there and smash it down.

1190
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:53,296
But nothing can breach it.

1191
02:06:56,224 --> 02:06:58,467
Grond will breach it.

1192
02:07:01,897 --> 02:07:03,973
Bring up the wolf's head.

1193
02:07:07,152 --> 02:07:12,490
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1194
02:07:12,824 --> 02:07:16,657
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1195
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:21,996
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1196
02:07:22,709 --> 02:07:26,373
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1197
02:07:26,795 --> 02:07:30,959
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1198
02:07:31,134 --> 02:07:34,835
Grond! Grond! Grond!!
