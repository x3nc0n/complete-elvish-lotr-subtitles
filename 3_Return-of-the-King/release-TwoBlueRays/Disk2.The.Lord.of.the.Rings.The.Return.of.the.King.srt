These English & Foreign subtitles created by ZoowlCZ (ver. 2024-10) are an expanded version of the English subtitles created by Bokutox of YIFY-TORRENTS (Torporr of Outland PVP (EU)).

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,951
You may go no further.

3
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,720
You will not enter Gondor.

4
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:27,203
Who are you to deny us passage?

5
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,258
Legolas...

6
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:31,187
...fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

7
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,475
Mind your aim.

8
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,432
That's it. Right. We warned you.

9
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,681
Prepare to be boarded.

10
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,781
Boarded?

11
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,786
By you and whose army?

12
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,471
This army.

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,487
In there.

14
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,583
What is this place?

15
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:24,165
Master must go inside the tunnel.

16
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:29,322
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

17
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,698
It's the only way.

18
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,178
Go in...

19
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,182
...or go back.

20
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,540
I can't go back.

21
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:01,554
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

22
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,510
Orcses come in here sometimes.

23
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:11,357
Hurry.

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,366
This way.

25
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,001
Smeagol?

26
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,127
Over here.

27
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,106
It's sticky. What is it?

28
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,606
You will see.

29
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,474
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,805
You will see.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,642
Smeagol?

32
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,172
Smeagol!

33
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,633
Smeagol!

34
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,672
Sam.

35
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,590
And you, Frodo Baggins...

36
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,532
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

37
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,987
May it be a light for you in dark places...

38
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,294
...when all other lights go out.

39
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,858
[Quenya] <i>Aiya Eärendil, Elenion Ancalima!</i>
[English] Hail Eärendil, Brightest of the Stars!

40
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,872
Naughty little fly.

41
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:33,828
Why does he cry?

42
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:37,422
Caught in a web

43
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,047
Soon you'll be...

44
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,708
Eaten.

45
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,213
Got away, did it, precious?

46
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,598
Not this time.

47
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:27,790
- Not this time!
- No!

48
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,844
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

49
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:41,271
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

50
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,177
We promised.

51
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,060
You must believe us.

52
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,625
It was the precious.

53
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:52,151
The precious made us do it.

54
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,662
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

55
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:24,356
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

56
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:35,853
No!

57
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,476
I'm so sorry, Sam.

58
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:08,517
I'm so sorry.

59
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:39,064
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

60
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,721
If you do not find a way...

61
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:45,846
no one will.

62
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:21,661
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

63
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:24,116
The lower level's in flames.

64
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,032
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

65
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,027
Time is against us.

66
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:30,323
Make ready!

67
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,321
Take heart, Merry.

68
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,705
It will soon be over.

69
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:36,997
My lady...

70
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:40,123
you are fair and brave...

71
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:42,884
and have much to live for...

72
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:46,528
and many who love you.

73
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,039
I know it is too late to turn aside.

74
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:55,782
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

75
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,749
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

76
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,700
But
- I'm not.

77
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:05,708
I'm a Hobbit.

78
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,918
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

79
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,615
I just want to help my friends.

80
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,202
Frodo.

81
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,791
Sam.

82
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,415
Pippin.

83
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,429
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

84
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:37,452
Prepare to move out!

85
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:41,067
Make haste. We ride through the night.

86
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:58,464
To battle.

87
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,443
To battle.

88
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:25,090
Back to the gate!

89
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,539
Hurry!

90
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:51,919
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

91
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,563
Thus have I walked.

92
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,939
And thus now will I sleep.

93
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,925
Gondor is lost.

94
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:10,836
There is no hope for Men.

95
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,263
Why do the fools fly?

96
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,888
Better to die sooner than late.

97
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,090
For die we must.

98
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:53,059
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

99
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:59,414
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

100
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,715
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

101
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,219
Bring wood and oil.

102
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,387
Steady.

103
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,599
Steady.

104
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,740
You are soldiers of Gondor.

105
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:38,584
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

106
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:45,855
Run!

107
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:49,575
Volley!

108
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:51,895
Fire!

109
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,191
Let him go, you filth.

110
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,629
Let him go!

111
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,326
You will not touch him again.

112
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,067
Come on and finish it.

113
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,254
Back!

114
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,622
Mr. Frodo.

115
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:13,873
Oh, no.

116
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,005
Frodo.

117
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,172
Mr. Frodo.

118
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:24,238
Wake up.

119
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:30,489
Don't leave me here alone.

120
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:34,448
Don't go where I can't follow.

121
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,021
Wake up.

122
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:48,876
Not asleep.

123
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,939
Dead.

124
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:13,722
You get back, you scum!

125
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,713
What's this?

126
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:28,463
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

127
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,631
Killed another one, has she?

128
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:34,767
No.

129
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,782
This fellow ain't dead.

130
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,954
Not dead?

131
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:47,892
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

132
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,174
Then she has her way with them.

133
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,779
That's how she likes to feed.

134
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,862
Fresh blood.

135
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,258
Get him to the tower!

136
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,707
Samwise, you fool.

137
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:06,592
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

138
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:09,144
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

139
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,647
The house of his spirit crumbles.

140
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,252
He is burning.

141
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:41,909
Already burning.

142
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:43,836
He's not dead.

143
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:46,180
He's not dead!

144
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,938
No! No!

145
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:52,430
No! No!

146
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:54,878
He's not dead!

147
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,681
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

148
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,016
I release you from my service.

149
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,692
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

150
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,099
Pour oil on the wood!

151
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:15,856
Come on, soldier! Move it!

152
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,275
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

153
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,183
Where is Gandalf?

154
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,683
Gandalf!

155
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:30,507
Retreat!

156
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,413
The city is breached!

157
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:37,487
Fall back! To the second level!

158
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:43,112
Get the women and children out!

159
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,884
Get them out!

160
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,499
Retreat!

161
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:48,583
Come on. Come on, move.

162
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:53,113
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

163
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,428
Take them down!

164
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,024
Fight! Fight to the last man!

165
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,690
Fight for your lives!

166
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,032
Gandalf!

167
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:35,461
Gandalf!

168
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:38,223
Denethor has lost his mind!

169
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,619
He's burning Faramir alive!

170
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,598
Up! Quickly!

171
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:50,880
Go back to the abyss.

172
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:56,036
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

173
00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:02,705
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

174
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:06,945
This is my hour.

175
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:18,173
Gandalf!

176
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:30,624
You have failed.

177
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:36,562
The world of Men will fall.

178
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:34,795
Courage, Merry.

179
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,453
Courage for our friends.

180
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:44,403
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

181
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:47,610
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

182
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,018
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

183
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,321
Flank ready.

184
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,237
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

185
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:07,196
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

186
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:09,905
Forth, and fear no darkness!

187
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:13,968
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

188
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:19,488
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

189
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:23,291
a sword-day, a red day...

190
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,965
and the sun rises!

191
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:39,491
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

192
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,721
Ride now!

193
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,092
Ride now!

194
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,753
Ride! Ride for ruin...

195
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:58,139
and the world's ending!

196
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:03,452
- Death!
- Death!

197
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:07,618
- Death!
- Death!

198
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,223
- Death!
- Death!

199
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,912
- Death!
- Death!

200
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:21,526
For Eorlingas!

201
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:05,906
Fire!

202
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,948
Death!

203
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,209
Charge!

204
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:18,347
Fire at will!

205
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:19,142
Set a fire in our flesh.

206
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,676
Stay this madness!

207
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:47,426
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

208
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:51,594
but against the power that has risen in the east...

209
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,823
there is no victory.

210
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,025
No!

211
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,941
You will not take my son from me!

212
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,077
No!

213
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:43,682
Faramir.

214
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:01,184
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

215
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,187
Drive them to the river!

216
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,824
Make safe the city!

217
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,285
Re-form the line!

218
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:20,359
Re-form the line!

219
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:30,308
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

220
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,964
Charge!

221
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:52,973
Cut him down!

222
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:22,403
Take the reins. Pull him left!

223
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:25,892
Left!

224
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:45,114
Aim for their heads!

225
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:54,490
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

226
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,105
Merry!

227
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,751
Merry!

228
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,071
I didn't think it would end this way.

229
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:27,883
End?

230
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:31,479
No, the journey doesn't end here.

231
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,687
Death is just another path...

232
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,552
one that we all must take.

233
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,083
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

234
00:36:44,187 --> 00:36:47,625
and all turns to silver glass.

235
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,689
And then you see it.

236
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,116
What, Gandalf?

237
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,721
See what?

238
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,846
White shores...

239
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,962
and beyond.

240
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,398
A far green country...

241
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,888
under a swift sunrise.

242
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,775
Well...

243
00:37:18,827 --> 00:37:20,390
that isn't so bad.

244
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,692
No.

245
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,650
No, it isn't.

246
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:45,340
Rally to me! To me!

247
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,654
Feast on his flesh.

248
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,218
I will kill you if you touch him.

249
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:22,740
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

250
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:35,039
Late as usual, pirate scum!

251
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,069
There's knife-work here needs doing.

252
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:40,937
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

253
00:39:56,056 --> 00:39:58,430
There's plenty for the both of us.

254
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,874
May the best Dwarf win.

255
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,444
You fool.

256
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:24,029
No man can kill me.

257
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:29,572
Die now.

258
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:42,234
I am no man.

259
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:02,242
- 15! 16!
- 17!

260
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,946
Merry!

261
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,707
Legolas!

262
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:20,456
33, 34.

263
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,878
That still only counts as one!

264
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:12,207
Come on, then. Come on!

265
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:58,721
I know your face...

266
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:02,423
Eowyn.

267
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:07,384
My eyes darken.

268
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:09,910
No.

269
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:12,411
No.

270
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,921
I am going to save you.

271
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:20,588
You already did.

272
00:44:24,266 --> 00:44:25,889
Eowyn...

273
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,881
my body is broken.

274
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:37,387
You have to let me go.

275
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,840
I go to my fathers...

276
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:50,142
in whose mighty company...

277
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,932
I shall not now feel ashamed.

278
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,144
Eowyn.

279
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:01,063
Release us.

280
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:04,690
Bad idea.

281
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:08,568
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

282
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:10,851
You gave us your word.

283
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:14,715
I hold your oath fulfilled.

284
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:17,396
Go.

285
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,936
Be at peace.

286
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,136
Merry.

287
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,043
No!

288
00:47:12,585 --> 00:47:15,345
No!

289
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:42,901
With a sigh.

290
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:46,775
You turn away.

291
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:50,943
With a deepening heart.

292
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:55,871
No more words to say.

293
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:59,517
You will find.

294
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:08,059
That the world has changed forever.

295
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:40,532
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

296
00:48:44,396 --> 00:48:49,209
And the sun is now fading.

297
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:59,377
I wish I could hold you closer.

298
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,482
Merry!

299
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,129
Merry!

300
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:20,288
Merry.

301
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:23,999
Merry, it's me.

302
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,172
It's Pippin.

303
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:32,959
I knew you'd find me.

304
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,328
Yes.

305
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:38,831
Are you going to leave me?

306
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:41,088
No, Merry.

307
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:44,621
I'm going to look after you.

308
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:30,004
Hands off!

309
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:33,342
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

310
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:37,755
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

311
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:43,179
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

312
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,117
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

313
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:11,516
The scum tried to knife me.

314
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,507
Kill him!

315
00:52:56,578 --> 00:52:58,642
That's for Frodo!

316
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:01,147
And for the Shire!

317
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,857
And that's for my old Gaffer!

318
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,653
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

319
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:45,486
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

320
00:53:52,731 --> 00:53:54,483
Not if I stick you first.

321
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,168
Sam!

322
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,304
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

323
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:05,487
Sorry for everything.

324
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,654
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

325
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:12,694
They've taken it. Sam...

326
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:14,986
they took the Ring.

327
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:18,445
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

328
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,615
I thought I'd lost you.

329
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:34,701
So I took it.

330
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,944
Only for safekeeping.

331
00:54:39,194 --> 00:54:40,945
Give it to me.

332
00:54:44,454 --> 00:54:46,700
Give me the Ring, Sam.

333
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,615
Sam.

334
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:56,160
Give me the Ring.

335
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:18,154
You must understand.

336
00:55:21,646 --> 00:55:23,492
The Ring is my burden.

337
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,823
It will destroy you, Sam.

338
00:55:29,979 --> 00:55:31,955
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

339
00:55:33,261 --> 00:55:34,916
We best find you some clothes.

340
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:38,118
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

341
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:02,041
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

342
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:04,832
We made it to Mordor.

343
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:07,829
There are so many of them.

344
00:56:08,796 --> 00:56:11,367
We'll never get through unseen.

345
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:19,836
It's him, the Eye.

346
00:56:27,547 --> 00:56:30,167
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

347
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:32,669
There's nothing for it.

348
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:40,082
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

349
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:52,673
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

350
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:56,811
The darkness is deepening.

351
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:59,155
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

352
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,589
It's only a matter of time.

353
00:57:03,062 --> 00:57:05,499
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

354
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:11,031
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

355
00:57:11,187 --> 00:57:12,959
Let him stay there.

356
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:15,844
Let him rot! Why should we care?

357
00:57:15,907 --> 00:57:21,241
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

358
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:30,460
I've sent him to his death.

359
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,292
No.

360
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:36,211
There is still hope for Frodo.

361
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:40,679
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

362
00:57:41,763 --> 00:57:44,334
- We can give him that.
- How?

363
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:47,383
Draw out Sauron's armies.

364
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:49,677
Empty his lands.

365
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,970
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

366
00:57:53,535 --> 00:57:56,596
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

367
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,341
Not for ourselves.

368
00:57:58,536 --> 00:58:04,139
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

369
00:58:05,933 --> 00:58:09,713
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

370
00:58:10,464 --> 00:58:11,672
A diversion.

371
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:13,640
Certainty of death...

372
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:16,558
small chance of success...

373
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,010
what are we waiting for?

374
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:22,006
Sauron will suspect a trap.

375
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:24,847
He will not take the bait.

376
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,840
Oh, I think he will.

377
00:59:03,127 --> 00:59:05,835
Long have you hunted me.

378
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,022
Long have I eluded you.

379
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:11,432
No more.

380
00:59:13,076 --> 00:59:15,554
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

381
01:00:00,007 --> 01:00:02,517
The city has fallen silent.

382
01:00:04,174 --> 01:00:07,228
There is no warmth left in the sun.

383
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:09,735
It grows so cold.

384
01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:15,771
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

385
01:00:22,145 --> 01:00:25,355
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

386
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,533
Look, the Orcs...

387
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,066
they're moving off.

388
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:01,191
You see, Mr. Frodo...

389
01:01:01,368 --> 01:01:03,691
some luck at last.

390
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,693
Move it, you slugs!

391
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:10,359
Come on! Faster!

392
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:21,473
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

393
01:01:21,484 --> 01:01:26,029
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

394
01:01:28,871 --> 01:01:30,538
Come on!

395
01:01:30,704 --> 01:01:32,914
What have I told you?

396
01:01:32,934 --> 01:01:35,225
No evation...

397
01:01:36,214 --> 01:01:38,037
Now move it!

398
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:41,364
Get up!

399
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:44,413
Come on, you slugs!

400
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:48,195
You two are going straight to the front line!

401
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:53,664
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

402
01:02:06,218 --> 01:02:10,021
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

403
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:23,038
Don't you know we're at war?

404
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:48,204
Company, halt!

405
01:02:52,004 --> 01:02:55,411
Inspection!

406
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:58,041
Sam, help me.

407
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:00,038
Mr. Frodo!

408
01:03:02,734 --> 01:03:05,290
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

409
01:03:05,442 --> 01:03:07,288
It's so heavy.

410
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:17,585
Oh, no.

411
01:03:23,204 --> 01:03:25,206
What do I do? What do we do?

412
01:03:28,257 --> 01:03:29,419
- Hit me.
- What?

413
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,629
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

414
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,375
Get off of me!

415
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:36,373
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

416
01:03:44,978 --> 01:03:47,047
Get off of me!

417
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,875
Break it up! Break it up!

418
01:03:52,427 --> 01:03:57,043
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

419
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:59,500
Go, Sam. Now!

420
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:09,969
Move along, scum!

421
01:04:10,136 --> 01:04:12,044
Back in the line!

422
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:14,344
You maggots!

423
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:18,010
Get back into the line, you slugs!

424
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:23,877
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

425
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:14,681
I can't...

426
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:18,596
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

427
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:19,924
It's... It's...

428
01:05:20,092 --> 01:05:22,673
It's such a weight to carry.

429
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:24,591
It's...

430
01:05:24,728 --> 01:05:26,725
Such a weight.

431
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:34,156
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

432
01:05:35,509 --> 01:05:38,740
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

433
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:55,722
Mr. Frodo.

434
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:58,724
Look.

435
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,139
There is light...

436
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:05,044
and beauty up there...

437
01:06:05,304 --> 01:06:07,771
that no shadow can touch.

438
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,402
Take mine.

439
01:07:00,882 --> 01:07:03,025
There's a few drops left.

440
01:07:18,176 --> 01:07:20,810
There will be none left for the return journey.

441
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,904
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

442
01:07:59,395 --> 01:08:01,393
[Black Speech] <i> Kelkum-ishi. </i>
[English]  In the coldness.

443
01:08:17,713 --> 01:08:19,902
Frodo, get down!

444
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,570
Hide!

445
01:08:33,705 --> 01:08:35,743
Frodo!

446
01:08:41,519 --> 01:08:42,991
Where are they?

447
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:22,077
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

448
01:09:22,982 --> 01:09:25,835
Let justice be done upon him!

449
01:10:09,236 --> 01:10:13,244
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

450
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,788
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

451
01:10:23,144 --> 01:10:26,292
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

452
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:28,977
faithless and accursed.

453
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:32,988
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

454
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:35,906
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

455
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,421
Old Greybeard.

456
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:45,133
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

457
01:10:50,136 --> 01:10:51,463
Frodo.

458
01:10:54,303 --> 01:10:55,760
Frodo.

459
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:57,958
- Silence.
- No!

460
01:10:58,563 --> 01:11:00,130
Silence!

461
01:11:01,898 --> 01:11:05,673
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

462
01:11:06,586 --> 01:11:10,756
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

463
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:22,012
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

464
01:11:24,608 --> 01:11:26,759
And he did, Gandalf.

465
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:28,673
He did.

466
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:37,175
And who is this?

467
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:39,423
Isildur's heir?

468
01:11:39,558 --> 01:11:42,597
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

469
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:49,921
I guess that concludes negotiations.

470
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:53,256
I do not believe it.

471
01:11:55,236 --> 01:11:56,641
I will not.

472
01:12:07,794 --> 01:12:09,793
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

473
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:14,517
Pull back.

474
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:16,849
Pull back!

475
01:12:18,985 --> 01:12:20,984
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

476
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:31,100
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

477
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,543
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

478
01:12:36,647 --> 01:12:38,561
Something's drawn its gaze.

479
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:55,080
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

480
01:12:56,023 --> 01:12:58,814
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

481
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,893
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

482
01:13:07,692 --> 01:13:09,647
I see in your eyes...

483
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:14,066
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

484
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:19,776
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

485
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:23,392
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

486
01:13:23,422 --> 01:13:26,235
But it is not this day.

487
01:13:26,495 --> 01:13:29,560
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

488
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:32,604
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

489
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:35,231
But it is not this day.

490
01:13:35,402 --> 01:13:37,061
This day we fight!

491
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:43,189
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

492
01:13:43,361 --> 01:13:47,605
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

493
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:19,528
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

494
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:22,320
What about side by side with a friend?

495
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,614
Aye.

496
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:30,246
I could do that.

497
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:02,616
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

498
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:07,825
It'll be spring soon.

499
01:16:08,595 --> 01:16:11,328
And the orchards will be in blossom.

500
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,163
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

501
01:16:16,513 --> 01:16:20,539
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

502
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:25,960
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

503
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:30,367
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

504
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:33,669
No, Sam.

505
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:36,789
I can't recall the taste of food...

506
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:41,203
nor the sound of water...

507
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,959
nor the touch of grass.

508
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:47,463
I'm...

509
01:16:48,339 --> 01:16:49,713
naked in the dark.

510
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,667
There's... there's nothing.

511
01:16:53,808 --> 01:16:58,544
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

512
01:16:59,798 --> 01:17:01,706
I can see him...

513
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,791
with my waking eyes.

514
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:07,293
Then let us be rid of it...

515
01:17:07,872 --> 01:17:10,122
once and for all.

516
01:17:10,841 --> 01:17:12,916
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

517
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,710
I can't carry it for you...

518
01:17:16,102 --> 01:17:18,171
but I can carry you.

519
01:17:18,707 --> 01:17:20,459
Come on!

520
01:17:50,846 --> 01:17:53,796
Aragorn.

521
01:18:05,326 --> 01:18:09,076
Elessar.

522
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:22,336
For Frodo.

523
01:18:57,258 --> 01:18:58,762
Look, Mr. Frodo.

524
01:18:59,446 --> 01:19:01,682
A doorway.

525
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:03,928
We're almost there.

526
01:19:06,269 --> 01:19:10,216
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

527
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:25,805
Mustn't go that way.

528
01:19:27,313 --> 01:19:29,809
Mustn't hurt the precious.

529
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:31,722
You swore!

530
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:33,972
You swore on the precious!

531
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,811
Smeagol promised!

532
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,722
Smeagol lied.

533
01:20:33,154 --> 01:20:35,067
Frodo!

534
01:21:02,115 --> 01:21:03,899
Eagles.

535
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:06,815
The eagles are coming!

536
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,489
Frodo!

537
01:21:36,701 --> 01:21:38,022
I'm here, Sam.

538
01:21:45,453 --> 01:21:47,118
Destroy it!

539
01:21:57,641 --> 01:22:00,945
Go on! Now!

540
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,655
Throw it in the fire!

541
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,706
What are you waiting for?

542
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,951
Just let it go!

543
01:22:57,126 --> 01:22:59,366
The Ring is mine.

544
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:04,660
No.

545
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:06,365
No.

546
01:23:14,785 --> 01:23:17,462
No!

547
01:25:01,774 --> 01:25:03,678
Yes!

548
01:25:04,848 --> 01:25:06,554
Yes!

549
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:10,549
Precious! Precious!

550
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:13,888
Precious! Precious!

551
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,596
Give me your hand!

552
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,344
Take my hand!

553
01:26:21,991 --> 01:26:23,350
No!

554
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:32,561
Don't you let go.

555
01:26:37,148 --> 01:26:38,725
Don't let go.

556
01:26:40,327 --> 01:26:41,816
Reach!

557
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:13,776
Frodo!

558
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:17,365
Frodo!

559
01:29:38,626 --> 01:29:40,493
It's gone.

560
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:46,701
It's done.

561
01:29:47,168 --> 01:29:49,201
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

562
01:29:50,554 --> 01:29:52,991
It's over now.

563
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:20,999
I can see the Shire.

564
01:30:23,214 --> 01:30:25,537
The Brandywine River.

565
01:30:27,641 --> 01:30:29,662
Bag End.

566
01:30:31,964 --> 01:30:34,708
Gandalf's fireworks.

567
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:38,877
The lights in the Party Tree.

568
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:43,498
Rosie Cotton dancing.

569
01:30:44,621 --> 01:30:47,334
She had ribbons in her hair.

570
01:30:50,248 --> 01:30:53,209
If ever I was to marry someone...

571
01:30:54,103 --> 01:30:56,374
it would've been her.

572
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,874
It would've been her.

573
01:31:11,968 --> 01:31:15,216
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

574
01:31:19,469 --> 01:31:22,426
here at the end of all things.

575
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:14,059
Gandalf?

576
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,682
Frodo!

577
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:57,268
Gimli!

578
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:43,907
Now come the days of the king.

579
01:35:48,872 --> 01:35:51,236
May they be blessed.

580
01:36:11,478 --> 01:36:14,166
This day does not belong to one man...

581
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:16,205
but to all.

582
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:20,789
Let us together rebuild this world...

583
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:25,201
that we may share in the days of peace.

593
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,632
My friends...

594
01:39:06,912 --> 01:39:09,600
you bow to no one.

595
01:39:53,688 --> 01:39:55,851
And thus it was.

596
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:59,637
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

597
01:39:59,782 --> 01:40:02,350
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

598
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:07,015
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

599
01:40:07,178 --> 01:40:09,594
was ended.

600
01:40:14,576 --> 01:40:19,396
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

601
01:40:19,523 --> 01:40:23,773
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

602
01:40:26,296 --> 01:40:29,019
We were home.

603
01:40:35,567 --> 01:40:37,439
Hi.

604
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,815
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

605
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:46,443
More of the same, Rosie.

606
01:41:46,617 --> 01:41:48,606
Good night, lads.

607
01:42:46,102 --> 01:42:50,117
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

608
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,661
How do you go on...

609
01:42:53,811 --> 01:42:59,034
when in your heart you begin to understand...

610
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:03,241
there is no going back?

611
01:43:03,916 --> 01:43:07,620
There are some things that time cannot mend...

612
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:11,040
some hurts that go too deep...

613
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,625
that have taken hold.

614
01:43:53,712 --> 01:43:55,627
Mr. Frodo?

615
01:43:58,922 --> 01:44:00,338
What is it?

616
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:06,118
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

617
01:44:06,787 --> 01:44:09,499
It's never really healed.

618
01:44:13,454 --> 01:44:18,715
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

619
01:44:19,392 --> 01:44:23,247
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

620
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,914
You finished it.

621
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:30,293
Not quite.

622
01:44:31,061 --> 01:44:33,669
There's room for a little more.

623
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:40,508
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

624
01:44:40,644 --> 01:44:43,959
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

625
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:47,675
Bilbo's story was now over.

626
01:44:48,145 --> 01:44:51,091
There would be no more journeys for him...

627
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:52,800
save one.

628
01:44:53,511 --> 01:44:57,157
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

629
01:44:57,261 --> 01:44:59,293
To the harbor, Bilbo.

630
01:44:59,449 --> 01:45:02,171
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

631
01:45:02,313 --> 01:45:04,964
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

632
01:45:06,636 --> 01:45:08,337
Frodo...

633
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:14,301
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

634
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,169
The one I gave you.

635
01:45:20,805 --> 01:45:22,961
I'm sorry, Uncle.

636
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:28,133
I'm afraid I lost it.

637
01:45:28,306 --> 01:45:30,096
Oh.

638
01:45:30,649 --> 01:45:32,180
Pity.

639
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,795
I should like to have held it one last time.

640
01:46:07,893 --> 01:46:12,972
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

641
01:46:27,114 --> 01:46:30,476
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

642
01:46:31,228 --> 01:46:34,055
The time has come...

643
01:46:34,197 --> 01:46:37,480
for the dominion of Men.

644
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,918
[Sindarin] <i>I Aear cân ven na mar.</i>
[English] The sea calls us to home.

645
01:46:49,876 --> 01:46:52,054
I think I'm...

646
01:46:52,221 --> 01:46:56,604
quite ready for another adventure.

647
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:29,937
Farewell...

648
01:47:30,088 --> 01:47:32,859
my brave Hobbits.

649
01:47:34,777 --> 01:47:36,809
My work is now finished.

650
01:47:40,611 --> 01:47:45,607
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

651
01:47:46,236 --> 01:47:49,111
comes the end of our Fellowship.

652
01:47:52,643 --> 01:47:55,143
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

653
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:59,814
for not all tears are an evil.

654
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:19,272
It is time, Frodo.

655
01:48:24,782 --> 01:48:26,814
What does he mean?

656
01:48:29,261 --> 01:48:32,150
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

657
01:48:33,741 --> 01:48:36,491
And it has been saved.

658
01:48:40,149 --> 01:48:42,825
But not for me.

659
01:48:43,742 --> 01:48:46,196
You don't mean that.

660
01:48:47,388 --> 01:48:49,483
You can't leave.

661
01:48:57,910 --> 01:49:00,654
The last pages are for you, Sam.

662
01:52:33,557 --> 01:52:36,426
My dear Sam

663
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:41,679
You cannot always be torn in two.

664
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:45,974
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

665
01:52:46,579 --> 01:52:52,177
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

666
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:56,597
Your part in the story will go on.

667
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:59,093
Well...

668
01:53:00,956 --> 01:53:02,683
I'm back.

669
01:58:59,981 --> 01:59:05,431
...into the west.
