These English & Foreign subtitles created by ZoowlCZ (ver. 2024-10) are an expanded version of the English subtitles created by Bokutox of YIFY-TORRENTS (Torporr of Outland PVP (EU)).

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,951
You may go no further.

3
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,720
You will not enter Gondor.

4
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:27,203
Who are you to deny us passage?

5
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,258
Legolas...

6
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:31,187
...fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

7
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,475
Mind your aim.

8
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,432
That's it. Right. We warned you.

9
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,681
Prepare to be boarded.

10
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,781
Boarded?

11
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,786
By you and whose army?

12
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,471
This army.

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,487
In there.

14
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,583
What is this place?

15
00:01:20,883 --> 00:01:24,165
Master must go inside the tunnel.

16
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:29,322
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

17
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,698
It's the only way.

18
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,178
Go in...

19
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,182
...or go back.

20
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,540
I can't go back.

21
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:01,554
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

22
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,510
Orcses come in here sometimes.

23
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:11,357
Hurry.

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,366
This way.

25
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,001
Smeagol?

26
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,127
Over here.

27
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,106
It's sticky. What is it?

28
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,606
You will see.

29
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,474
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:45,805
You will see.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,642
Smeagol?

32
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,172
Smeagol!

33
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,633
Smeagol!

34
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,672
Sam.

35
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,590
And you, Frodo Baggins...

36
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,532
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

37
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,987
May it be a light for you in dark places...

38
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,294
...when all other lights go out.

39
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:14,858
[Quenya] <i>Aiya Eärendil, Elenion Ancalima!</i>
[English] Hail Eärendil, Brightest of the Stars!

40
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,872
Naughty little fly.

41
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:33,828
Why does he cry?

42
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:37,422
Caught in a web

43
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,047
Soon you'll be...

44
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,708
Eaten.

45
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,213
Got away, did it, precious?

46
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,598
Not this time.

47
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:27,790
- Not this time!
- No!

48
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,844
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

49
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:41,271
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

50
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,177
We promised.

51
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,060
You must believe us.

52
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,625
It was the precious.

53
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:52,151
The precious made us do it.

54
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:12,775
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

55
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,983
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

56
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,126
No!

57
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,283
I'm so sorry, Sam.

58
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,323
I'm so sorry.

59
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,974
This task was appointed to you...

60
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,423
...Frodo of the Shire.

61
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,420
If you do not find a way...

62
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,512
...no one will.

63
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,559
The scouts report Minas
Tirith is surrounded.

64
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:24,943
The lower level's in flames.

65
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,805
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

66
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,507
Time is against us.

67
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,158
Make ready!

68
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,174
Take heart, Merry.

69
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,537
It will soon be over.

70
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,643
My lady...

71
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,871
...you are fair and brave...

72
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,716
...and have much to live for...

73
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,407
...and many who love you.

74
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,792
I know it is too late to turn aside.

75
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:56,574
I know there is not much
point now in hoping.

76
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,831
If I were a knight of Rohan...

77
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,942
...capable of great deeds, but...

78
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,216
...I'm not.

79
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,634
I'm a Hobbit.

80
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,698
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

81
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:17,368
I just want to help my friends.

82
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,982
Frodo.

83
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:23,450
Sam.

84
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,047
Pippin.

85
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,229
More than anything, I wish
I could see them again.

86
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:38,438
Prepare to move out!

87
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:41,953
Make haste. We ride through the night.

88
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,664
To battle.

89
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,060
To battle.

90
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,092
Back to the gate!

91
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:28,298
Hurry!

92
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,636
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

93
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,561
Thus have I walked.

94
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:59,872
And thus now will I sleep.

95
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:07,684
Gondor is lost.

96
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:11,722
There is no hope for Men.

97
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,156
Why do the fools fly?

98
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:33,781
Better to die sooner than late.

99
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,029
For die we must.

100
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,946
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

101
00:13:54,675 --> 00:14:00,065
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

102
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:05,528
We shall burn, like the
heathen kings of old.

103
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:11,079
Bring wood and oil.

104
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,536
Steady.

105
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,444
Steady.

106
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,646
You are soldiers of Gondor.

107
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:39,476
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

108
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,581
Run!

109
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,174
Volley!

110
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,721
Fire!

111
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:48,502
Let him go, you filth.

112
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,555
Let him go!

113
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:55,266
You will not touch him again.

114
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,047
Come on and finish it.

115
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,299
Back!

116
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,048
Mr. Frodo.

117
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,726
Oh, no.

118
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:17,224
Frodo.

119
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:19,424
Mr. Frodo.

120
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,317
Wake up.

121
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,701
Don't leave me here alone.

122
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:35,547
Don't go where I can't follow.

123
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:41,340
Wake up.

124
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,002
Not asleep.

125
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,291
Dead.

126
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,002
You get back, you scum!

127
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:25,759
What's this?

128
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,039
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

129
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,963
Killed another one, has she?

130
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:36,127
No.

131
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:41,311
This fellow ain't dead.

132
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,804
Not dead?

133
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:49,092
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

134
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,543
Then she has her way with them.

135
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,053
That's how she likes to feed.

136
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,158
Fresh blood.

137
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,611
Get him to the tower!

138
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,183
Samwise, you fool.

139
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,051
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

140
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:10,316
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

141
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:37,927
The house of his spirit crumbles.

142
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,529
He is burning.

143
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,258
Already burning.

144
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,212
He's not dead.

145
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,532
He's not dead!

146
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,549
No! No!

147
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,849
No! No!

148
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:56,261
He's not dead!

149
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:59,712
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

150
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,437
I release you from my service.

151
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:08,978
Go now and die in what
way seems best to you.

152
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,638
Pour oil on the wood!

153
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,148
Come on, soldier! Move it!

154
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,875
Hurry along there! Hurry along!

155
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,984
Gandalf!

156
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,617
Where is Gandalf?

157
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:25,069
Gandalf!

158
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:31,779
Retreat!

159
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:35,731
The city is breached!

160
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,168
Fall back!

161
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,744
To the second level!

162
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,518
Get the women and children out!

163
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,210
Get them out!

164
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,872
Retreat!

165
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,392
Come on. Come on, move.

166
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:54,739
Move into the city.
Kill all in your path.

167
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:05,141
Take them down!

168
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:26,735
Fight!

169
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,646
Fight to the last man!

170
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:30,181
Fight for your lives!

171
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:31,235
Gandalf!

172
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:36,960
Gandalf!

173
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:39,092
Denethor has lost his mind!

174
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:42,194
He's burning Faramir alive!

175
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,224
Up! Quickly!

176
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,433
Go back to the abyss.

177
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:57,311
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

178
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,836
Do you not know death when
you see it, old man?

179
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:08,327
This is my hour.

180
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,513
Gandalf!

181
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,138
You have failed.

182
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:38,044
The world of Men will fall.

183
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,336
Courage, Merry.

184
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,995
Courage for our friends.

185
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:45,931
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

186
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,264
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

187
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:00,437
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

188
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:01,525
Flank ready.

189
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:04,537
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

190
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:08,790
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

191
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,326
Forth, and fear no darkness!

192
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,983
Arise!

193
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,168
Arise Riders of Theoden!

194
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,975
Spears shall be shaken!

195
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:20,765
Shields shall be splintered!

196
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,057
A sword-day!

197
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:24,971
A red day!

198
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,440
And the sun rises!

199
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:39,401
Whatever happens, stay with me.

200
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,613
I'll look after you.

201
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,376
Ride now!

202
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:52,533
Ride now!

203
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:54,825
Ride!

204
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,411
Ride for ruin!

205
00:26:56,576 --> 00:27:00,128
And the world's ending!

206
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:05,094
- Death!
- Death!

207
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,192
- Death!
- Death!

208
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,130
- Death!
- Death!

209
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,927
- Death!
- Death!

210
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,222
For Eorlingas!

211
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,414
Fire!

212
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,523
Death!

213
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,690
Charge!

214
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:19,882
Fire at will!

215
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,771
Set a fire in our flesh.

216
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,391
Stay this madness!

217
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,985
You may triumph in the
field of battle for a day...

218
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,162
...but against the power
that has risen in the east...

219
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,572
...there is no victory.

220
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,791
No!

221
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,812
You will not take my son from me!

222
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:38,061
No!

223
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:45,687
Faramir.

224
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:02,969
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

225
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:33,052
Drive them to the river!

226
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,696
Make safe the city!

227
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,158
Re-form the line!

228
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:22,404
Re-form the line!

229
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,755
Sound the charge!

230
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,207
Take them head-on!

231
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,730
Charge!

232
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,739
Cut him down!

233
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:23,294
Take the reins.

234
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:24,615
Pull him left!

235
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,891
Left!

236
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:47,013
Aim for their heads!

237
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:56,596
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

238
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:03,188
Merry!

239
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,517
Merry!

240
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,343
I didn't think it would end this way.

241
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,042
End?

242
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,578
No, the journey doesn't end here.

243
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:38,326
Death is just another path...

244
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,597
...one that we all must take.

245
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:46,132
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

246
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:49,595
...and all turns to silver glass.

247
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,767
And then you see it.

248
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:58,295
What, Gandalf?

249
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:00,886
See what?

250
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:03,918
White shores...

251
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,121
...and beyond.

252
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,430
A far green country...

253
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:15,047
...under a swift sunrise.

254
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,874
Well...

255
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,462
...that isn't so bad.

256
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,768
No.

257
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,816
No, it isn't.

258
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,720
Rally to me!

259
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:47,404
To me!

260
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:12,081
Feast on his flesh.

261
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:19,339
I will kill you if you touch him.

262
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:24,987
Do not come between the Nazgul
and his prey.

263
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,270
Late as usual!

264
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:37,120
Pirate scum!

265
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,082
There's knife-work here needs doing.

266
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:43,405
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

267
00:39:58,097 --> 00:40:00,471
There's plenty for the both of us.

268
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,995
May the best Dwarf win.

269
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:22,345
You fool.

270
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:26,036
No man can kill me.

271
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,573
Die now.

272
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,491
I am no man.

273
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,296
- 15! 16!
- 17!

274
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:14,067
Merry!

275
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:57,828
Legolas!

276
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:20,961
33.

277
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:22,664
34.

278
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,835
That still only counts as one!

279
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,629
Come on, then. Come on!

280
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:00,841
I know your face...

281
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,663
Eowyn.

282
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:09,505
My eyes darken.

283
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,137
No.

284
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:14,532
No.

285
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:19,189
I am going to save you.

286
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:22,709
You already did.

287
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,010
Eowyn...

288
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:32,162
...my body is broken.

289
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,508
You have to let me go.

290
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:48,088
I go to my fathers...

291
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,443
...in whose mighty company...

292
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,252
I shall not now feel ashamed.

293
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:14,438
Eowyn.

294
00:46:00,935 --> 00:46:03,430
Release us.

295
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,941
Bad idea.

296
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,201
Very handy in a
tight spot, these lads.

297
00:46:09,386 --> 00:46:10,950
Despite the
fact they're dead.

298
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:13,232
You gave us your word.

299
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:17,096
I hold your oath fulfilled.

300
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:19,770
Go.

301
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:22,370
Be at peace.

302
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:07,656
Merry.

303
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,583
No!

304
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,659
No!

305
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:45,022
♫ With a sigh. ♫

306
00:47:45,298 --> 00:47:48,896
♫ You turn away. ♫

307
00:47:49,312 --> 00:47:53,064
♫ With a deepening heart. ♫

308
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:57,992
♫ No more words to say. ♫

309
00:47:58,434 --> 00:48:01,563
♫ You will find. ♫

310
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:09,636
♫That the world has changed forever. ♫

311
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:43,218
♫ And the trees are now turning
from green to gold. ♫

312
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:51,588
♫ And the sun is now fading. ♫

313
00:48:51,613 --> 00:49:01,676
♫ I wish I could hold you closer. ♫

314
00:49:04,645 --> 00:49:05,921
Merry!

315
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,654
Merry!

316
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:22,967
Merry.

317
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:26,438
Merry, it's me.

318
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,690
It's Pippin.

319
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,224
I knew you'd find me.

320
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,847
Yes.

321
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,030
Are you going to leave me?

322
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,674
No, Merry.

323
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,220
I'm going to look after you.

324
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:32,535
Hands off!

325
00:50:32,688 --> 00:50:36,287
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

326
00:50:36,312 --> 00:50:40,472
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

327
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:45,361
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

328
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:51,775
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

329
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,227
The scum tried to knife me.

330
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,218
Kill him!

331
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,353
That's for Frodo!

332
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:03,984
And for the Shire!

333
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,568
And that's for my old Gaffer!

334
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,363
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

335
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,358
I'm gonna bleed you...

336
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:48,916
...like a stuck pig.

337
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:57,194
Not if I stick you first.

338
00:53:57,476 --> 00:53:59,038
Sam!

339
00:54:03,932 --> 00:54:06,015
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

340
00:54:06,268 --> 00:54:08,006
Sorry for everything.

341
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,499
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late.

342
00:54:11,092 --> 00:54:12,450
It's over.

343
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:13,864
They've taken it.

344
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:15,749
Sam...

345
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:17,830
...they took the Ring.

346
00:54:18,412 --> 00:54:21,156
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

347
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:35,180
I thought I'd lost you.

348
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:37,290
So I took it.

349
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:40,801
Only for safekeeping.

350
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,801
Give it to me.

351
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:49,717
Give me the Ring, Sam.

352
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:55,632
Sam.

353
00:54:56,885 --> 00:54:58,850
Give me the Ring.

354
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:20,984
You must understand.

355
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:26,308
The Ring is my burden.

356
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,693
It will destroy you, Sam.

357
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,972
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

358
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:37,628
We best find you some clothes.

359
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:41,030
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

360
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:05,102
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

361
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,893
We made it to Mordor.

362
00:56:09,105 --> 00:56:10,763
There are so many of them.

363
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,301
We'll never get through unseen.

364
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:20,902
It's him...

365
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,576
...the Eye.

366
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:33,101
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

367
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:35,603
There's nothing for it.

368
00:56:38,574 --> 00:56:39,630
Come on.

369
00:56:40,176 --> 00:56:42,228
Let's just make it down the hill
for starters.

370
00:56:52,193 --> 00:56:55,607
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

371
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,745
The darkness is deepening.

372
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:02,089
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

373
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,523
It's only a matter of time.

374
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:08,433
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

375
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:13,965
...behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

376
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:15,893
Let him stay there.

377
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:17,367
Let him rot!

378
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,914
Why should we care?

379
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:24,311
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

380
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:33,530
I've sent him to his death.

381
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,362
No.

382
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:39,281
There is still hope for Frodo.

383
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:43,749
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

384
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,366
We can give him that.

385
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:47,421
How?

386
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,366
Draw out Sauron's armies.

387
00:57:50,616 --> 00:57:52,747
Empty his lands.

388
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,840
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

389
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:59,666
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

390
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:01,304
Not for ourselves.

391
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:07,209
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

392
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:12,710
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

393
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,587
A diversion.

394
00:58:14,612 --> 00:58:16,433
Certainty of death...

395
00:58:16,817 --> 00:58:19,194
...small chance of success...

396
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,080
What are we waiting for?

397
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:25,076
Sauron will suspect a trap.

398
00:58:25,879 --> 00:58:27,917
He will not take the bait.

399
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:31,910
Oh, I think he will.

400
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,905
Long have you hunted me.

401
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,092
Long have I eluded you.

402
00:59:12,873 --> 00:59:14,171
No more.

403
00:59:16,146 --> 00:59:18,624
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

404
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,587
The city has fallen silent.

405
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:10,298
There is no warmth left in the sun.

406
01:00:11,098 --> 01:00:12,805
It grows so cold.

407
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:18,841
It's just the damp of
the first spring rain.

408
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,425
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

409
01:00:57,101 --> 01:00:58,716
Look, the Orcs...

410
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:01,268
they're moving off.

411
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,394
You see, Mr. Frodo...

412
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:06,913
some luck at last.

413
01:01:06,938 --> 01:01:08,763
Move it, you slugs!

414
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:11,480
Come on!

415
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:13,202
Faster!

416
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:24,543
Come along, you coldhearted 
wretched scum...

417
01:01:24,554 --> 01:01:29,099
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

418
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,675
Come on!

419
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:35,984
What have I told you?

420
01:01:36,004 --> 01:01:38,295
No evation...

421
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,613
Now move it!

422
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:44,434
Get up!

423
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:47,483
Come on, you slugs!

424
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:51,265
You two are going straight 
to the front line!

425
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:57,120
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

426
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:11,230
To the Gate, you slugs!

427
01:02:11,255 --> 01:02:13,483
Now, move it!

428
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:26,214
Don't you know we're at war?

429
01:02:48,284 --> 01:02:49,878
Company!

430
01:02:50,056 --> 01:02:51,241
Halt!

431
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:58,481
Inspection!

432
01:02:58,829 --> 01:02:59,918
Sam...

433
01:03:00,198 --> 01:03:01,198
...help me.

434
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:02,265
Mr. Frodo!

435
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:07,309
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.

436
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:08,360
Stand up!

437
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:10,358
It's so heavy.

438
01:03:19,605 --> 01:03:20,808
Oh, no.

439
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,432
What do...

440
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:28,485
What do we do?

441
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,705
- Hit me.
- What?

442
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,910
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

443
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:36,511
Get off of me!

444
01:03:36,928 --> 01:03:39,262
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

445
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,270
Get off of me!

446
01:03:51,129 --> 01:03:53,058
Break it up! Break it up!

447
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,547
Oi!

448
01:03:56,885 --> 01:04:00,328
I'll have your guts if you don't 
shut this rabble down!

449
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:01,362
Go, Sam.

450
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:02,448
 Now!

451
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,261
Move along, scum!

452
01:04:13,286 --> 01:04:15,194
Back in the line!

453
01:04:16,216 --> 01:04:18,027
You maggots!

454
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:21,080
Get back into the line, you slugs!

455
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:27,206
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

456
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:16,969
I can't...

457
01:05:18,187 --> 01:05:19,201
I can't...

458
01:05:19,225 --> 01:05:20,899
...I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

459
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:23,484
It's... It's...

460
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:25,316
It's such a weight to carry.

461
01:05:26,872 --> 01:05:27,886
It's...

462
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:29,908
...such a weight.

463
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,313
We're going that way.

464
01:05:36,337 --> 01:05:37,618
Straight as we can.

465
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:42,156
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

466
01:05:57,249 --> 01:05:59,178
Mr. Frodo.

467
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:02,073
Look.

468
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:06,002
There is light...

469
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:08,330
...and beauty up there...

470
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:11,441
...that no shadow can touch.

471
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,408
Take mine.

472
01:07:04,516 --> 01:07:06,501
There's a few drops left.

473
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:24,147
There will be none left
for the return journey.

474
01:07:25,282 --> 01:07:28,467
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

475
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:06,549
[Black Speech] <i> Kelkum-ishi. </i>
[English]  In the coldness.

476
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:23,525
Frodo, get down!

477
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:26,774
Hide!

478
01:08:37,088 --> 01:08:39,021
Frodo!

479
01:08:45,096 --> 01:08:46,568
Where are they?

480
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,680
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

481
01:09:26,592 --> 01:09:29,004
Let justice be done upon him!

482
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:16,833
My master, Sauron the Great, 
bids thee welcome.

483
01:10:22,715 --> 01:10:26,297
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

484
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:29,703
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

485
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:31,367
...faithless...

486
01:10:31,392 --> 01:10:32,432
...and accursed.

487
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:34,297
Tell your master this:

488
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,655
The armies of Mordor must disband.

489
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:39,501
He is to depart these lands, 
never to return.

490
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:43,050
Old Greybeard.

491
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,783
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

492
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:55,173
Frodo.

493
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,301
Frodo.

494
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,097
Silence.

495
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:01,789
No!

496
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:03,097
Silence!

497
01:11:05,446 --> 01:11:08,743
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

498
01:11:10,216 --> 01:11:14,386
Know that he suffered greatly 
at the hands of his host.

499
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:22,601
Who would've thought one so small...

500
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:25,968
...could endure so much pain?

501
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,369
And he did, Gandalf.

502
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:32,026
He did.

503
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,838
And who is this?

504
01:11:40,909 --> 01:11:43,066
Isildur's heir?

505
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:46,347
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

506
01:11:51,202 --> 01:11:53,804
I guess that concludes negotiations.

507
01:11:55,902 --> 01:11:57,099
I do not believe it.

508
01:11:58,985 --> 01:12:00,390
I will not.

509
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,927
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

510
01:12:16,554 --> 01:12:17,983
Pull back.

511
01:12:18,746 --> 01:12:20,170
Pull back!

512
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,537
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

513
01:12:32,898 --> 01:12:34,630
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

514
01:12:36,736 --> 01:12:40,279
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

515
01:12:40,304 --> 01:12:42,218
Something's drawn its gaze.

516
01:12:54,974 --> 01:12:57,306
[Black Speech] <i> Ash nazg durb! </i>
[English]  One Ring to rule!

517
01:12:59,953 --> 01:13:02,744
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

518
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,076
Sons of Gondor!

519
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:07,379
Of Rohan!

520
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:08,816
My brothers!

521
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:13,343
I see in your eyes...

522
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:17,660
...the same fear that would 
take the heart of me.

523
01:13:19,874 --> 01:13:21,417
A day may come...

524
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:23,575
...when the courage of Men fails...

525
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,356
...when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

526
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:29,261
But it is not this day.

527
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,095
An hour of wolves...

528
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,632
...and shattered shields...

529
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:36,535
...when the age of Men comes crashing down.

530
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:39,290
But it is not this day.

531
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:40,974
This day we fight!

532
01:13:42,993 --> 01:13:45,561
By all that you hold dear...

533
01:13:45,586 --> 01:13:47,215
...on this good earth...

534
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,882
I bid you stand!

535
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:51,212
Men of the West!

536
01:15:19,945 --> 01:15:23,487
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

537
01:15:23,956 --> 01:15:26,279
What about side by side with a friend?

538
01:15:29,896 --> 01:15:31,680
Aye.

539
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:34,412
I could do that.

540
01:16:04,512 --> 01:16:06,607
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

541
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,223
It'll be spring soon.

542
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,124
And the orchards will be in blossom.

543
01:16:15,585 --> 01:16:18,602
And the birds will be nesting 
in the hazel thicket.

544
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:24,198
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

545
01:16:25,691 --> 01:16:29,619
...and eating the first of
the strawberries with cream.

546
01:16:31,993 --> 01:16:34,492
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

547
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:37,794
No, Sam.

548
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,302
I can't recall the taste of food...

549
01:16:42,023 --> 01:16:43,190
...nor the...

550
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:45,135
...the sound of water...

551
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:46,800
...nor the...

552
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:49,084
...touch of grass.

553
01:16:50,015 --> 01:16:51,588
I'm...

554
01:16:52,464 --> 01:16:53,838
...naked in the dark.

555
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:56,605
There's...

556
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:57,792
...there's nothing.

557
01:16:57,933 --> 01:16:59,183
No veil...

558
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:00,550
...between me...

559
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,384
...and the wheel of fire.

560
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:05,229
I can see him...

561
01:17:06,308 --> 01:17:08,009
...with my waking eyes.

562
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:11,418
Then let us be rid of it...

563
01:17:11,997 --> 01:17:14,247
...once and for all.

564
01:17:14,966 --> 01:17:17,041
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

565
01:17:17,205 --> 01:17:19,835
I can't carry it for you...

566
01:17:20,227 --> 01:17:22,296
...but I can carry you.

567
01:17:22,832 --> 01:17:24,584
Come on!

568
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:57,751
Aragorn.

569
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:13,354
Elessar.

570
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:25,402
For Frodo.

571
01:19:01,348 --> 01:19:02,852
Look, Mr. Frodo.

572
01:19:03,636 --> 01:19:04,891
A doorway.

573
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,179
We're almost there.

574
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:14,454
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

575
01:19:28,186 --> 01:19:30,220
Mustn't go that way.

576
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:33,893
Mustn't hurt the precious.

577
01:19:33,918 --> 01:19:35,847
You swore!

578
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:38,186
You swore on the precious!

579
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,169
Smeagol promised!

580
01:19:42,843 --> 01:19:44,718
Smeagol lied.

581
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,485
Frodo!

582
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:07,713
Eagles.

583
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,391
The eagles are coming!

584
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:35,614
Frodo!

585
01:21:41,212 --> 01:21:42,533
I'm here, Sam.

586
01:21:49,798 --> 01:21:51,463
Destroy it!

587
01:22:02,023 --> 01:22:03,023
Go on!

588
01:22:03,282 --> 01:22:04,282
Now!

589
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:07,167
Throw it in the fire!

590
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,488
What are you waiting for?

591
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:27,967
Just let it go!

592
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,830
The Ring is mine.

593
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:08,305
No.

594
01:23:09,495 --> 01:23:10,495
No.

595
01:23:19,116 --> 01:23:20,624
No!

596
01:25:06,285 --> 01:25:08,189
Yes!

597
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:10,872
Yes!

598
01:25:12,122 --> 01:25:13,135
Precious!

599
01:25:13,269 --> 01:25:14,674
Precious!

600
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,326
Precious! Precious!

601
01:26:11,286 --> 01:26:13,153
Give me your hand!

602
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,915
Take my hand!

603
01:26:26,403 --> 01:26:27,762
No!

604
01:26:35,171 --> 01:26:37,146
Don't you let go.

605
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:43,316
Don't let go.

606
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:46,501
Reach!

607
01:28:15,538 --> 01:28:17,697
Frodo!

608
01:28:18,724 --> 01:28:21,743
Frodo!

609
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,097
It's gone.

610
01:29:49,477 --> 01:29:50,977
It's done.

611
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,460
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

612
01:29:55,512 --> 01:29:57,012
It's over now.

613
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,590
I can see the Shire.

614
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:29,745
The Brandywine River.

615
01:30:32,472 --> 01:30:34,493
Bag End.

616
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:39,190
Gandalf's fireworks.

617
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,612
The lights...

618
01:30:41,977 --> 01:30:43,821
...in the Party Tree.

619
01:30:44,902 --> 01:30:47,307
Rosie Cotton dancing.

620
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,539
She had ribbons in her hair.

621
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,727
If ever I was to marry someone...

622
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:01,266
it would've been her.

623
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:04,539
It would've been her.

624
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,948
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

625
01:31:24,434 --> 01:31:27,175
...here at the end of all things.

626
01:33:16,944 --> 01:33:18,623
Gandalf?

627
01:33:38,481 --> 01:33:40,513
Frodo!

628
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:02,153
Gimli!

629
01:35:45,185 --> 01:35:47,922
Now come the days of the king.

630
01:35:53,923 --> 01:35:56,287
May they be blessed.

631
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:19,064
This day does not belong to one man...

632
01:36:19,329 --> 01:36:21,243
...but to all.

633
01:36:22,878 --> 01:36:25,834
Let us together rebuild this world...

634
01:36:26,003 --> 01:36:29,269
...that we may share in the days of peace.

My friends...

01:39:12,143 --> 01:39:14,831
...you bow to no one.

646
01:39:59,005 --> 01:40:00,569
And thus it was.

647
01:40:01,297 --> 01:40:04,215
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

648
01:40:05,259 --> 01:40:07,202
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

649
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,111
...though eternally bound by friendship...

650
01:40:10,246 --> 01:40:11,704
...and love...

651
01:40:12,442 --> 01:40:13,964
...was ended.

652
01:40:19,893 --> 01:40:22,044
Thirteen months to the day...

653
01:40:22,069 --> 01:40:24,713
...since Gandalf sent us on
our long journey...

654
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:28,901
...we found ourselves looking 
upon a familiar sight.

655
01:40:31,786 --> 01:40:33,430
We were home.

656
01:40:40,953 --> 01:40:41,977
Hi.

657
01:40:59,897 --> 01:41:02,132
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

658
01:41:50,162 --> 01:41:51,687
More of the same, Rosie.

659
01:41:51,712 --> 01:41:53,701
Good night, lads.

660
01:42:51,725 --> 01:42:55,424
How do you pick up the threads 
of an old life?

661
01:42:56,989 --> 01:42:58,503
How do you go on...

662
01:42:59,355 --> 01:43:00,944
when... in your heart...

663
01:43:01,617 --> 01:43:03,617
...you begin to understand...

664
01:43:05,818 --> 01:43:07,818
 ...there is no going back?

665
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:11,995
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

666
01:43:13,464 --> 01:43:15,964
...some hurts that go too deep...

667
01:43:18,339 --> 01:43:20,339
...that have taken hold.

668
01:43:59,165 --> 01:44:00,337
Mr. Frodo?

669
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:05,906
What is it?

670
01:44:07,718 --> 01:44:10,821
It's been four years to the
day since Weathertop, Sam.

671
01:44:12,355 --> 01:44:15,067
It's never really healed.

672
01:44:18,869 --> 01:44:23,486
"There and Back Again." A Hobbit's tale 
by Bilbo Baggins.

673
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,815
And "The Lord of the Rings" 
by Frodo Baggins.

674
01:44:29,284 --> 01:44:31,482
You finished it.

675
01:44:34,337 --> 01:44:35,861
Not quite.

676
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:38,629
There's room for a little more.

677
01:44:41,837 --> 01:44:43,638
Bilbo once told me..

678
01:44:43,663 --> 01:44:46,076
...his part in this tale would end...

679
01:44:46,212 --> 01:44:49,527
...that each of us must come 
and go in the telling.

680
01:44:50,587 --> 01:44:52,728
Bilbo's story was now over.

681
01:44:53,816 --> 01:44:56,192
There would be no more journeys for him...

682
01:44:57,087 --> 01:44:58,668
...save one.

683
01:44:59,079 --> 01:45:00,812
Tell me again, lad...

684
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:02,725
...where are we going?

685
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:04,861
To the harbor, Bilbo.

686
01:45:05,017 --> 01:45:07,739
The Elves have accorded
you a special honor...

687
01:45:07,977 --> 01:45:10,628
...a place on the last ship 
to leave Middle-earth.

688
01:45:12,204 --> 01:45:13,905
Frodo...

689
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:19,669
...any chance of seeing that old 
Ring of mine again?

690
01:45:20,488 --> 01:45:22,737
The one I gave you.

691
01:45:26,132 --> 01:45:28,288
I'm sorry, Uncle.

692
01:45:31,061 --> 01:45:33,061
I'm afraid I lost it.

693
01:45:33,874 --> 01:45:34,874
Oh.

694
01:45:36,217 --> 01:45:37,217
Pity.

695
01:45:40,488 --> 01:45:44,363
I should like to have
held it one last time.

696
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:18,699
Well, here's a sight I
have never seen before.

697
01:46:32,715 --> 01:46:36,077
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

698
01:46:36,989 --> 01:46:38,989
The time has come...

699
01:46:39,972 --> 01:46:42,472
for the dominion of Men.

700
01:46:43,699 --> 01:46:46,906
[Sindarin] <i>I Aear cân ven na mar.</i>
[English] The sea calls us to home.

701
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,110
I think I'm...

702
01:46:57,982 --> 01:47:01,482
...quite ready for another adventure.

703
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:34,649
Farewell...

704
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,916
...my brave Hobbits.

705
01:47:40,518 --> 01:47:42,550
My work is now finished.

706
01:47:46,312 --> 01:47:48,007
Here at last...

707
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:50,820
...on the shores of the sea...

708
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:54,825
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

709
01:47:58,717 --> 01:48:01,217
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

710
01:48:01,388 --> 01:48:05,382
...for not all tears are an evil.

711
01:48:23,087 --> 01:48:25,026
It is time, Frodo.

712
01:48:30,469 --> 01:48:32,501
What does he mean?

713
01:48:35,102 --> 01:48:37,996
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

714
01:48:39,629 --> 01:48:42,129
And it has been saved.

715
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:47,910
But not for me.

716
01:48:49,522 --> 01:48:51,522
You don't mean that.

717
01:48:53,209 --> 01:48:55,304
You can't leave.

718
01:49:03,477 --> 01:49:06,221
The last pages are for you, Sam.

719
01:52:39,585 --> 01:52:41,585
My dear Sam

720
01:52:44,330 --> 01:52:47,389
You cannot always be torn in two.

721
01:52:47,793 --> 01:52:51,510
You will have to be one and 
whole for many years.

722
01:52:52,607 --> 01:52:57,609
You have so much to enjoy 
and to be and to do.

723
01:52:59,380 --> 01:53:01,895
Your part in the story will go on.

724
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:05,033
Well...

725
01:53:06,843 --> 01:53:08,570
I'm back.

726
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:05,599
...into the west.
